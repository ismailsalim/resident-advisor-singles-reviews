Ex-Terrestrial - Urth Born,Pacific Rhythm,PR003,"Downtempo, Ambient, House",February 2018,Post a comment,3.6,"Dance music history is a limited resource, and the more depleted it becomes, the deeper you have to dig to find the new in the old. These days we're well into previously taboo zones: hardcore and gabber, say, or forms of ambient and new age previously dismissed as cheesy and insipid. Adam Feingold occupies the latter zone, having mined '90s chill-out and Balearic as Ex-Terrestrial since 2016, and his pristine new EP—the first on Pacific Rhythm from a non-Vancouver artist—hits on a new seam. Bits of this EP call to mind not the chill-out music that accompanied '90s rave culture, but the ultra-smooth coffee table music that accompanied its global commercialisation.
 Which isn't to say that the EP is bad. There's no detectable shred of irony, and it's steered by the confident hand Feingold brings to all of his music. You'll probably find yourself absorbed even as you scratch your head at some of Feingold's stylistic choices, like the bits of vaguely ""ethnic"" string instrument on ""Urth Man,"" for instance, which float along in an ultra-smooth breakbeat current. Or the defanged liquid drum & bass beats on ""Everybody Dreams,"" whose groove is so fast and light that it bypasses the body entirely, letting you sink into the slower pulse of synth chord and twinkling piano. The languid mood firms up on the lower-tempo ""Water Walk,"" where a muffled ""Funky Drummer"" break bobs around on oceanic chords. Fellow NAFF boss Priori turns the track into slow-burning ambient house, bringing us back onto firmer aesthetic ground—and not necessarily for the better.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22198
Kym Sugiru - Ophelia,Diskotopia,DSK038,"Electro, Dancehall",February 2018,Post a comment,3.6,"Ophelia is an eccentric take on two styles we've heard a lot of lately: dancehall and electro. It's from Kym Sugiru, a Tokyo-based producer whose debut—not unlike Diskotopia, the label releasing it—is pleasingly slippery and digressive. ""Tanka,"" the electro track, has a nimble kalimba pattern that winds through coarse snares. Some details, such as the low-volume vocal babble, are almost imperceptible. Others, like the snippets of chat from Japanese high school students (apparently discussing poetry homework), slip in and out of a busy foreground, where you'll also hear harmonica, electronic cicada chirps and wafting hi-tech soul harmonies.
 There's more room on the wonky cosmic dancehall of ""Ophelia (Floriography),"" but Sugiru's quirky musical signatures remain. Onbeat tonal slides, rubbery rhythmic accents, dubby echo trails and mumbled nonsense all drift happily in the A-side's crooked currents. Its crunchy, not-quite-lo-fi ambience is grazed and scratched by scrapyard one-shots, but another balmy stroke—this time, faint choral vocals—takes the edge off.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22237
Stanislav Tolkachev - Catacomb Saints,Pohjola,POHLTD0015,"Techno, Ambient",February 2018,Post a comment,3.7,"Stanislav Tolkachev revels in disorientating arp sequences and staccato arrangements, but he's no stranger to eerie beatless tangents. Last year's VHS Pt. 1 on Italy's Delirio showed his slower side, using double bass, piano and plinky synths for four melancholic and depressive tracks. His latest EP, Catacomb Saints, picks up where VHS Pt. 1 left off.  ""Why Are You So Frightened"" journeys through a tear-stained synth notes before the first hints of percussion creep in halfway through. Hi-hats dance around frantic bleeps, cutting through the tension of the sad beatless section. The track tiptoes between Tolkachev's two sides: spooky experimentation and cutting rhythms that urge you to get up and dance. The smooth pace contrasts with the full-throttle funk of ""4th Block,"" which follows a functional path. Tolkachev's tougher cuts tend to focus on expanding a central sequence to explore its limits, and ""4th Block"" is a great example of this. Veering among galloping kick drums and stomach-churning arpeggios, it's classic bare-boned Tolkachev.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22215
Various - Introduction EP,Intergraded,INTGRD001,1 / View,February 2018,3.8,3.8,"Harry Agius, AKA Midland, gives back to the scene with his new Intergraded label. It's a platform for emerging artists, and its first release contains debuts from the Londoners Jay and Peach, plus new tracks by Body In The Thames and Webstarr. Body In The Thames sets the stage with ""Silver Threaded Crystal Beads,"" a fun, percussion-heavy opener with a rhythm that reminds me of Errorsmith's ""Superlative Fatigue."" Peach has made waves for the last year and a half as a DJ and a host at Radar Radio and NTS. Her production debut, ""Silky,"" is a great example of the energetic house tracks she's known to spin. While the vocal sample pays homage to the style's more classic side, its fast-paced intensity is anything but nostalgic.
 ""Balsam Drum"" by the SIREN collective member Jay is blissful with varied drum patterns and a mix of organic and synthetic sounds. Its muffled kick drum rumbles before erupting into a satisfying 4/4 pattern, keeping pace with conga-like drums and a baseline that recalls the sound of bees humming. Jay strings these elements together effortlessly, as if they were dispatches from the same extraterrestrial club night. Webstarr's ""The Muse"" captures the darker moods of the dance floor, closing out a well-rounded EP that would be a solid weapon for any house and techno DJ's record bag.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22202
Taraval - No Coast,Hypercolour,HYPE069,Techno,March 2018,Post a comment,3.6,"Since his last record as Taraval, Ryan Smith has kept busy with some unusual collaborative projects. The Canadian's solo alias, however, sticks to a simple brief: to make characterful dance music for big rooms. Like the second of his two records for Four Tet's Text, No Coast veers from the disco-house flavours of Smith's early tracks towards a tougher and often darker techno sound. The most colour we get comes in ""Stan's Loon,"" where melodic flurries and glistening chords spice up a buoyant circa-120 BPM groove. Wild clap barrages don't enter until the last 90 seconds or so, the arrangement equivalent of getting two thirds through your jog and realising you've barely broken a sweat.
 But mostly the mood is gloomier. On ""No Coast"" a chilly klaxon bleep brings the dystopian drama, around which Smith sneaks in quietly funky percussion. The other tracks splay arps and chord stabs polyrhythmically across the groove—a standard big-room techno technique, only Smith's synths warp and wobble with an unusual gooey softness. ""Kima Jima""'s lead line is furtive, scuttling down the piano roll as if fleeing the scene of a crime, before gentler kosmische colouring soothes it. ""Topaz's Way"" lacks this calming element. It's the EP's straightest—and most banging—track, but it still has a hint of the oddball flair that marks Smith out.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22210
Binh - Eastern Bloc,Cabaret Recordings,CABARET016,"Minimal, Techno",February 2018,1,4.0,"Cabaret's streak of fresh and intriguing minimal that stretches the genre's parameters continues in 2018. Its first record of the year, Eastern Bloc, comes from their regular collaborator Binh. His first two EPs on the label—Downtown and Buyout—played with a toolbox of vocal samples, with his use of Drake's voice on ""Downtown"" recalling Madteo's creepy reimagining of the Canadian rapper on ""Rugrats Don't Techno For An Answer.""
 Straying from vocals, Binh's latest record for Cabaret is more in line with his recent work for other labels. He focusses on a different set of production tools that contrast with the icy toughness of Downtown and Buyout. Where the eerie presence of space lent unnerving character to those records, Eastern Bloc fills the void with Binh's production quirks. A warmth permeates the EP, conveyed through radiant synths, springy basslines and the upbeat roll of Binh's bouncy kick drums. ""Eastern Bloc"" and ""Revdone"" beam down rays through shiny melodies, sounds of a minimal master showing his sunnier side.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22236
Mica Levi - Delete Beach,DDS,DDS024,"Electronic, Experimental, Ambient",February 2018,3,3.9,"""I've just always been interested in those glisses,"" the composer Mica Levi said of glissandos, one of her musical signatures, the tonal slide where sweet can become sour, or, as on her BAFTA-nominated score for Under The Skin, something much worse. They're not as central to her latest film soundtrack, the anime short Delete Beach, but she leaves other recognisable marks. On ""Interlude 1,"" grave strings—not unlike those heard on Under The Skin—heave through simple kick-snare drums and bright synth melodies. Another melody—slightly warmer, no less aglow—is anchored by sleepy piano keys on ""Interlude 2."" The first track is Kuedo on codeine; the second is more hopeful.  They're of a piece with the Japanese, English and instrumental versions of ""Delete Beach."" On the first two, we're listening to a young ""burner"" or ""lemming"" on the beach lamenting her failure ""to join comrades underneath [the ocean], slowly becoming oil over time."" (In the film, oil is illegal, but the burners regard it with spiritual awe.) The music undergoes several phases, possibly dictated by the speaker's mood. At first, orchestral strings and sea waves lap gently, then, as she recalls moments from her past, feedback screeches amid cooing synth pads. (""Interlude 2""'s melody reappears shortly after.) Throughout these stark ambient passages, you get a sense of the world the narrator is railing against. Levi mirrors the ""defeated"" activist's perspective with suggestive contrasts: call-and-response tones, clean and dirty surfaces, high- and low-tech chirps, all shifting in the tides of the ocean the burner hasn't quite reached.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22157
Nathan Fake - Sunder,Ninja Tune,ZEN12471,"Techno, Electronica",February 2018,3,3.8,"""I've always been totally turned off by the idea of owning expensive, high-end equipment,"" Nathan Fake said around the time of 2015's Glaive EP. For that record he limited himself to an ancient copy of Cubase and a Roland SH-09 monosynth, and he's kept up the studio limitations since. On last year's Providence LP he broke two years of writer's block by picking up a Korg Prophecy. ""It's very hard to program, looks unimpressive, [and] doesn't sound great,"" he joked. And his latest EP features a ""Jupiter 6, broken Akai drum machine and a Yamaha Reface DX,"" with which Fake recorded a series of unedited one-take performances onto ""an old Marantz tape deck."" These are one-take straight-to-tape live jams, but Fake doesn't seem to be after the retro ""authenticity"" associated with that method by dozens of post-L.I.E.S. producers. Instead, his simple tools allow quicker access to the power that has animated much of his best music.  Each track is a concentrated dose of things Fake does well: long aching melodies and chord progressions, surging, dramatic crescendos, hectic drums. The strongest tracks, ""Sunder"" and ""Arcaibh,"" come first. The former is high-velocity techno, the latter a kind of electro. In both cases the drums slam the mix into the red, contrasting with the synths' pristine drift. The other tracks toy with different moods. There's a scarred IDM whimsy on ""Serotonin Drops"" and a triumphant tone on ""Cloudswept"" that doesn't sit so well with the swung drums. On ""Lea,"" Fake revels one last time in the materiality of his synths, making them glisten, fray and melt along unusual vectors. Where Providence showed that he can still make ambitious statements, this EP is a simpler pleasure.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22153
Albrecht La'Brooy - Tidal River,Apollo,AMB1801,"Ambient, Deep House",January 2018,3,3.7,"There has always been an appreciation of the outdoors in the lush work of Albrecht La'Brooy. Inspired by a visit to the coastal Wilsons Promontory national park, the Melbourne duo's first release on R&S's ambient sub-label, Apollo, reflects that appreciation. Tidal River's excellent opening track, ""Daybreak,"" sets the scene with twangs of wistful guitar and a sprinkling of piano. It has a bleary-eyed quality that's reminiscent of The KLF's classic ""Madrugada Eterna,"" but instead of zooming cars on an American highway, it echoes with the distant chirp of birds from the Australian bushland.
 Other tracks on the mini-album could suit the dance floor—or, more appropriately, the afterparty. Before building into a steady rhythm, ""View From The Peak"" warbles with gentle chords layered with a flicker of drums. Something similar happens in ""Tidal River,"" with its shuffling bassline and dabs of late-night piano. ""Sealers Cove"" is the most vigorous of a mild lot, ascending into a groove by the end of its nine-minute length. ""Darby Saddle"" departs from 4/4, with the intermittent rustling of percussion nestled in with warm strings and twinkling keys. The most accessible track, the Balearic-leaning ""Last Light,"" allures with silky saxophone and elegant drums. Tidal River isn't strictly an ambient release, but it's best listened to as one.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22197
Cesare vs Disorder ‎- Ararapira Jazz,Vakant,VA072,"Minimal, House",February 2018,2,3.5,"Minimal has gone through many phases over the years, and Vakant has dabbled in just about all of them. The Berlin label taps Spacetravel, a key producer pushing the style's move into cosmic terrain, for a remix on its latest EP, Cesare vs Disorder's Ararapira Jazz. Spacetravel turns the title track into an ultra-deep groover, little more than a thumping kick, sporadic electroid synth squiggles and frantic claps and hi-hats. The beat is tough, so it feels like the kind of tune best deployed in a party's final stages, when anything more complicated than a straight 4/4 pattern is tough to compute.
 The EP's original three tracks push more familiar minimal sounds. Thanks to a deep, rhythmic bassline, ""Ararapira Jazz"" is the pick of the bunch. Bright but subtle, its main melody is a mix of light chords and sparkling notes, building up and down as the bassline dances underneath. Ricardo Villalobos's influence is heard in the rhythm and vocals of ""Desorientado,"" while ""Dinner With Bogdan"" lays down more cheery synths over another hyperactive bassline. Ararapira Jazz is a great summer record, so let's hope it stays in DJ bags until then.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22265
Various - PGH Electro Vol. 1,Is / Was,IW03,Electro,February 2018,4,3.7,"Several Midwest-based producers have received some well-deserved attention lately. Thanks to killer records from Dwayne Jensen and Chase Smith, the Pittsburgh label Is / Was has been central to this development. Instead of the bounding charm of its first two releases, the PGH Electro Vol. 1 compilation shows a darker side of the Midwest scene, but it feels like a natural continuation from Smith's bouncy electro and acid jams. Hits Only's ""Trion-4"" grabs you with gracefully pirouetting hi-hats, pixelating synth arpeggios and sharp percussion. Feeling like two tracks in one, its first half has a UK techno vibe that slithers into gargling 303s and dizzying synth sequences.  Where the A-side holds tough rhythms with a polished sheen, Shawn Rudiman handles the B-side with the raw sound of modular workouts recorded in his overwhelmingly packed studio. The menacing acid-tinged electro of ""Asimolar"" thumps straight through your body. Rudiman's words in a recent documentary seem to apply here: ""It's like when you're waiting for a wave out in the ocean. You feel it picking up and you think, this is it—I'm riding this to the beach.""",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22174
Loco Dice - Roots,Desolat,DESOLAT060,"Techno, House",February 2018,8,2.9,"With help from his studio partner Martin Buttrich, Loco Dice spent much of the '00s supplementing his flourishing DJ career with a steady run of slick minimal bombs on labels like Ovum, Cadenza and Minus. ""Seeing Through Shadows"" and ""Tight Laces,"" which featured on Dice's excellent debut album, were hits on the world's coolest dance floors. But as his profile ballooned in the early '10s, his output slowed, before completely grinding to a halt around 2012. When he returned three years later with a new album packed with unlikely—and in some cases unfortunate—collaborations, the Dice of old was barely recognisable.  Three years later Dice seems to have had a change of heart. His latest single, ""Roots,"" might not capture the magic of the '00s, but it's far from a slice of cheesy pop-house. The first two minutes, in particular, are solid. A bleepy melody prances over crunchy drums, the groove frisky without overdoing it. Things slip in the second half, as expansive big-room synths, a second melody and the sound of a spring being flicked clutter the composition. The gruff vocal also jars, so reach for the instrumental version. Roots might show Dice back on the right path, but there's still a long way to go.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22264
P. Adrix - Álbum Desconhecido,Principe,P022,"Kuduro, Batida",February 2018,3,4.0,"Lisbon's post-kuduro batida community has churned out young producers since it first gained international recognition around 2013. But as with any newly popular scene, it can eventually become challenging telling artists apart. Enter P. Adrix. At a time when many immigrants are going the opposite direction, the Lisbon-native moved to Manchester three years ago at the tender age of 19.
 There's no telling what the move did to Adrix's music, which definitely has its own flavor. It has the sparseness of his Príncipe contemporaries, albeit with different relationship with bass, reflecting a love of hip-hop or perhaps the soundsystem culture so foundational in the UK. It's booming and elastic in the brief trap breakdown in ""Zelda Shyt"" and the mantric bounce of ""Abertura Da Roda,"" which isn't far from Jersey club. It's a good foundation for earworm flourishes like the woody clicks in ""Estação De Queluz,"" the flutey synths and heavy breathing accents of ""Viva La Raça"" and the sinuous tarraxo groove of ""Sonhos."" Like most post-kuduro batida, Álbum Desconhecido is fun and frantic with an oblong funk that outsiders will have a hard time replicating. For Adrix, the way his music rubs against other styles feels most exciting.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22199
Dengue Dengue Dengue - Son De Los Diablos,Enchufada,ENLP089,Bass,February 2018,2,3.8,"Few producers do percussion like Dengue Dengue Dengue. The Peruvian duo weave dense webs of interconnected grooves, balancing Afro-Latin rhythms and modern bass music. They don't shy away from using long samples or colorful lead melodies, bold songwriting elements that make their tracks feel like more than just DJ tools. They are in play on Son De Los Diablos (""Sound Of The Devils""), their first EP since the 2016 album, Siete Raíces.  The title track is a great example. Rather than going straight in with a percussive groove, they foment a tense mood with violin strokes resonating in negative space. The shakers and hand drums come in bit by bit, and the bass that kicks in at the one-minute mark is so thick that it's alarming. The melodies are almost always simple three- or four-note lines, but they're layered in a way that makes them work. That's especially clear on ""Buscando."" The digital marimba is just a little bit dissonant, making for an ambiguous tone somewhere between ominous and celebratory—a line these two are particularly good at towing. There's a yawning, fantasmic vocal clip (""Estoy buscando,"" or ""I'm searching"") that injects a bit of sadness, too.  ""Flootz"" centers on muffled loops of hand claps and chants tied to an unhurried 4/4 beat that will warm up a dance floor. A spacious mid-range makes it fun to DJ with, leaving plenty of room for incoming and outgoing tracks in the mix. ""Cobre,"" with its flute melodies and spacious reverb, contains whispers of classic dubstep tracks like Skream's ""Rutten,"" though the percussion skips instead of stomping. Son De Los Diablos is no real departure from what we heard on Siete Raíces, but as the old saying goes, if it ain't broke don't fix it.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22192
Philipp Otterbach ‎- Humans,Tour Messier,TM01,Techno,February 2018,Post a comment,3.8,"Humans is a murky and unsettling record. A sense of mystery is its most endearing quality, refusing to give up its secrets no matter how many times you hear it. The EP inaugurates the Dutch label Tour Messier, a new outlet intended for non-dance floor music with hidden depths. Featuring three ambient soundscapes and a groggy beat tune, Humans is the German artist Philipp Otterbach's first full EP. He's released more clubby fare in the past on the Essen/Berlin label Grokenberger Records, but even those tracks had a haunted quality. (Check ""Shake The Shackles,"" a two-part tribal meditation.) Otterbach is a heady producer, and Humans is his most potent collection to date.
 The first three tracks drift through eerie terrain. They're spacious but stifling compositions, filled with a scant few details and the faintest pulse of forward-motion. There are voices muttering to themselves in hushed tones—or are they trying to communicate? ""Mfz1YrpMbBg"" is loaded with shadowy moans, chanting and a female sample that, though inaudible, sounds distressed. Like a horror master, Otterbach only hints at a morbid picture, letting our imaginations do the rest. ""5CnAPD39cUQ"" works all that cinematic drama into a glutinous club track that oozes and glides.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22111
Martyn Bootyspoon - Silk Eternity,Fractal Fantasy,N/A,Club,February 2018,3,3.8,"Dance music can be faceless. It's hard to get a sense of a producer's personality based on the way they arrange their synthesizers, so it's refreshing when someone like Martyn Bootyspoon delivers an EP saturated with charisma. The Montreal artist has almost no prior solo discography, though he's worked with other producers on projects for Fractal Fantasy, the label run by Sinjin Hawke and Zora Jones. On Silk Eternity, he's not only the producer but the master of ceremonies, sermonizing over his own modern club rhythms.  The opening track, ""Spread That Kat,"" sets the tone, with its oversexed lyrics and a barebones drum machine beat that borrows from Night Slugs and Chicago house. ""Steam"" begins like a stripped-back drum track, but it erupts unexpectedly with bright synths that disappear just as quickly. ""The Grid"" is hilarious, with Bootyspoon delivering an erotic monologue about cloud computing and data mining over booming 808 kicks. ""What are you browsing?"" he teases. ""Let's go through your browser history. You browse my Instagram and your data plan is overflowing... with joy."" The seductive tone is reminiscent of '90s spoken-word house tracks, especially naughty ones like Cajmere's ""Chit Chat.""  Speaking of Chicago, it's impressive that Fractal Fantasy wrangled a remix from one of the city's most storied producers, Steve Poindexter, who's only put out a handful of tracks in the last eight years. He straightens the spastic rhythms of ""Spread That Kat"" into a punishing house banger. Not only a peak-time bomb, it's also a clever bit of A&R, considering the original samples Poindexter's classic ""Work That Motherfucker."" On the more abstract ""Helicoptah Dance,"" we hear Bootyspoon's knack for sound design, which comes across through the delicious synth textures. Silk Eternity is a colorful portrait of a larger-than-life character.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22191
Etienne - V3,Sequalog,SEQG003,"Techno, Electro, Minimal",February 2018,1,3.9,"It feels like Etienne has been making music for much longer than his relatively small catalogue suggests. His debut EP, Airmetique, began things in 2015 with techy rollers that had the swing of UK garage. But with skipping claves, claps and disorientating synths, it was his following record for the London-based Undersound Recordings that really launched his minimal sound. V3, Etienne's latest EP, veers in a different direction. In a shift first heard on last year's split EP with TC80, he streamlines some of the elements that characterised Dez, bringing a new dimension to his music.
 There has been an increase in minimal producers adopting the liquid waves of the 303, and Etienne is no exception. ""V3"" guides you through an underwater tunnel where metallic synths and aquatic acid sounds merge with a hefty kick, short claps and clacking hi-hats. The record glides along at a steady pace until ""Halycon""'s frantic stomp throws us into a peak-time dance floor, after which ""Azur"" cools the temperature with glacial pads that signal that the end of the night may be near.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22119
S & M Trading Co. - Metal Surface Repair,Fit,FIT019,"House, Techno",February 2018,2,3.7,"DJ Sotofett and Aaron ""FIT"" Siegel have worked together, on some level, for years. They've toured Europe as a duo, hosted each other at parties in Detroit and Berlin, remixed tracks and jammed together in various configurations. They've also managed to log some hours in Siegel's studio, housed in the pivotal US dance music store and distributor Submerge. It was only a matter of time until FIT and Sotofett launched an official collaborative project. Their debut as S & M Trading Co. was recorded way back in 2011, with each producer chipping away at the final versions in the years since.
 Siegel and Sotofett have a knack for crafting tracks with an epic scope. ""Metal Surface Repair"" fits the bill, cycling through three movements over the course of ten minutes. The melancholic intro recalls FIT's breakthrough track, ""Carmine,"" and low-key Detroit classics like Model 500's ""Pick Up The Flow."" After traversing a knotty, acidic middle section, we're treated to a gorgeous ambient techno resolve. A two-note 303 line complements Sotofett's loose, dubby percussion as skyward synths bring home the pensive, optimistic mood.  If you don't feel like waiting six minutes for that payoff, flip the record for the ""Synthetic Mix,"" an ambient version of ""Metal Surface Repair'""s stunning conclusion. Like Sotofett's recent collaboration with LNS, the ""Soft Peak Mix,"" the ambient piece is a winning gesture towards Artificial Intelligence-era influences. Metal Surface Repair is stuffed with ideas, but the best track off the duo's promising debut is its simplest.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22193
Aalko - No Man Is An Island,Kebko Music,KEB004,"Electronic, Techno, Experimental",January 2018,Post a comment,3.8,"Akiko Kiyama has made the weirdest music of her career during the past two years. From 2004 till 2015, her EPs and LPs surfaced on the sort of labels—Contexterrior, Lick My Deck, District Of Corruption—and mixes—most notably Richie Hawtin's DE9 | Transitions—you'd expect of a solid minimal techno producer. It's much harder to describe what Kiyama, as Aalko, is doing on No Man Is An Island. A three-track sampler from an album of the same name, the EP follows a series of experimental records on Kebko Music, the label Kiyama set up two years ago, where oddball composition has reigned, most notably on her excellent 2015 LP, Ophelia.
 ""Body & Soul""'s drum track is slashed in vandalising strokes by toms, flatulent synths, squeezed latex and anything else that will halt the rhythm. (A tongue-in-cheek bass guitar lick is the track's only constant.) ""Mixture"" is similarly unsettled. The breakbeats are thinly sliced, and often cut out suddenly. The percussion, a mix of live drum sounds and machine-derived claps and hats, is arranged in disjunctive, overlapping patterns. ""Mixture""s disorderly vibe is brought out by a digital slide whistle, which is both funny and annoying. If these arrhythmic stretches have limited appeal for fans of her old stuff, then the dub techno of ""B.I.C."" is a fine reminder of Kiyama's dance floor pedigree.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22188
Flow ‎- Trine,Tardis,TAR008,"Tech House, House",February 2018,10,4.2,"Recent EPs from artists like The Persuader and Losoul have seen Tardis push a deep and dubby sound suited to warm-up sets and afterhours. Trine, featuring three tracks produced in the '90s by the revered but little-known UK tech house artist Flow, puts the label back in the realm of peak-time DJs. The highlight is ""Boy Girl Action,"" a ten-minute house bomb that occupies the full A-side. It's built around a monster bassline that would take over a room if played through the right soundsystem, pitching up and down as snappy percussion skips above. The mood is serious but the groove is strong, buoyed by twisted licks of synth and vocals calling out from deep within the mix. There's no breakdown and the energy stays high for the full ten minutes, making this a tune you could play from beginning to end if the placement is right.  The two B-side tunes aim for different moods. ""Trine"" is introspective and vaguely positive, employing a bold bassline and shuffling drums. Its wailing female vocal, clipped from an unknown source, captures the sound of '90s rave, as do the cosmic pads that give the track a sentimental touch. An easygoing groove makes ""I See You"" the most versatile tune. There isn't a clear melody, so vocoder vocals and a ghostly whisper supply the colour, gliding atop yet another fat bassline. Already picked up by DJs like Ricardo Villalobos and Dorian Paic, it won't be long until Trine blows a hole in a dance floor near you.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22249
Various - Introduction EP,Intergraded,INTGRD001,1 / View,February 2018,3.8,3.8,"Harry Agius, AKA Midland, gives back to the scene with his new Intergraded label. It's a platform for emerging artists, and its first release contains debuts from the Londoners Jay and Peach, plus new tracks by Body In The Thames and Webstarr. Body In The Thames sets the stage with ""Silver Threaded Crystal Beads,"" a fun, percussion-heavy opener with a rhythm that reminds me of Errorsmith's ""Superlative Fatigue."" Peach has made waves for the last year and a half as a DJ and a host at Radar Radio and NTS. Her production debut, ""Silky,"" is a great example of the energetic house tracks she's known to spin.

Taraval - No Coast,Hypercolour,HYPE069,Techno,March 2018,Post a comment,3.6,"Since his last record as Taraval, Ryan Smith has kept busy with some unusual collaborative projects. The Canadian's solo alias, however, sticks to a simple brief: to make characterful dance music for big rooms. Like the second of his two records for Four Tet's Text, No Coast veers from the disco-house flavours of Smith's early tracks towards a tougher and often darker techno sound. The most colour we get comes in ""Stan's Loon,"" where melodic flurries and glistening chords spice up a buoyant circa-120 BPM groove. Wild clap barrages don't enter until the last 90 seconds or so, the arrangement equivalent of getting two thirds through your jog and realising you've barely broken a sweat.
 But mostly the mood is gloomier. On ""No Coast"" a chilly klaxon bleep brings the dystopian drama, around which Smith sneaks in quietly funky percussion. The other tracks splay arps and chord stabs polyrhythmically across the groove—a standard big-room techno technique, only Smith's synths warp and wobble with an unusual gooey softness. ""Kima Jima""'s lead line is furtive, scuttling down the piano roll as if fleeing the scene of a crime, before gentler kosmische colouring soothes it. ""Topaz's Way"" lacks this calming element. It's the EP's straightest—and most banging—track, but it still has a hint of the oddball flair that marks Smith out.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22210
Binh - Eastern Bloc,Cabaret Recordings,CABARET016,"Minimal, Techno",February 2018,1,4.0,"Cabaret's streak of fresh and intriguing minimal that stretches the genre's parameters continues in 2018. Its first record of the year, Eastern Bloc, comes from their regular collaborator Binh. His first two EPs on the label—Downtown and Buyout—played with a toolbox of vocal samples, with his use of Drake's voice on ""Downtown"" recalling Madteo's creepy reimagining of the Canadian rapper on ""Rugrats Don't Techno For An Answer.""
 Straying from vocals, Binh's latest record for Cabaret is more in line with his recent work for other labels. He focusses on a different set of production tools that contrast with the icy toughness of Downtown and Buyout. Where the eerie presence of space lent unnerving character to those records, Eastern Bloc fills the void with Binh's production quirks. A warmth permeates the EP, conveyed through radiant synths, springy basslines and the upbeat roll of Binh's bouncy kick drums. ""Eastern Bloc"" and ""Revdone"" beam down rays through shiny melodies, sounds of a minimal master showing his sunnier side.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22236
Mica Levi - Delete Beach,DDS,DDS024,"Electronic, Experimental, Ambient",February 2018,3,3.9,"""I've just always been interested in those glisses,"" the composer Mica Levi said of glissandos, one of her musical signatures, the tonal slide where sweet can become sour, or, as on her BAFTA-nominated score for Under The Skin, something much worse. They're not as central to her latest film soundtrack, the anime short Delete Beach, but she leaves other recognisable marks. On ""Interlude 1,"" grave strings—not unlike those heard on Under The Skin—heave through simple kick-snare drums and bright synth melodies. Another melody—slightly warmer, no less aglow—is anchored by sleepy piano keys on ""Interlude 2."" The first track is Kuedo on codeine; the second is more hopeful.  They're of a piece with the Japanese, English and instrumental versions of ""Delete Beach."" On the first two, we're listening to a young ""burner"" or ""lemming"" on the beach lamenting her failure ""to join comrades underneath [the ocean], slowly becoming oil over time."" (In the film, oil is illegal, but the burners regard it with spiritual awe.) The music undergoes several phases, possibly dictated by the speaker's mood. At first, orchestral strings and sea waves lap gently, then, as she recalls moments from her past, feedback screeches amid cooing synth pads. (""Interlude 2""'s melody reappears shortly after.) Throughout these stark ambient passages, you get a sense of the world the narrator is railing against. Levi mirrors the ""defeated"" activist's perspective with suggestive contrasts: call-and-response tones, clean and dirty surfaces, high- and low-tech chirps, all shifting in the tides of the ocean the burner hasn't quite reached.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22157
Nathan Fake - Sunder,Ninja Tune,ZEN12471,"Techno, Electronica",February 2018,3,3.8,"""I've always been totally turned off by the idea of owning expensive, high-end equipment,"" Nathan Fake said around the time of 2015's Glaive EP. For that record he limited himself to an ancient copy of Cubase and a Roland SH-09 monosynth, and he's kept up the studio limitations since. On last year's Providence LP he broke two years of writer's block by picking up a Korg Prophecy. ""It's very hard to program, looks unimpressive, [and] doesn't sound great,"" he joked. And his latest EP features a ""Jupiter 6, broken Akai drum machine and a Yamaha Reface DX,"" with which Fake recorded a series of unedited one-take performances onto ""an old Marantz tape deck."" These are one-take straight-to-tape live jams, but Fake doesn't seem to be after the retro ""authenticity"" associated with that method by dozens of post-L.I.E.S. producers. Instead, his simple tools allow quicker access to the power that has animated much of his best music.  Each track is a concentrated dose of things Fake does well: long aching melodies and chord progressions, surging, dramatic crescendos, hectic drums. The strongest tracks, ""Sunder"" and ""Arcaibh,"" come first. The former is high-velocity techno, the latter a kind of electro. In both cases the drums slam the mix into the red, contrasting with the synths' pristine drift. The other tracks toy with different moods. There's a scarred IDM whimsy on ""Serotonin Drops"" and a triumphant tone on ""Cloudswept"" that doesn't sit so well with the swung drums. On ""Lea,"" Fake revels one last time in the materiality of his synths, making them glisten, fray and melt along unusual vectors. Where Providence showed that he can still make ambitious statements, this EP is a simpler pleasure.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22153
Albrecht La'Brooy - Tidal River,Apollo,AMB1801,"Ambient, Deep House",January 2018,3,3.7,"There has always been an appreciation of the outdoors in the lush work of Albrecht La'Brooy. Inspired by a visit to the coastal Wilsons Promontory national park, the Melbourne duo's first release on R&S's ambient sub-label, Apollo, reflects that appreciation. Tidal River's excellent opening track, ""Daybreak,"" sets the scene with twangs of wistful guitar and a sprinkling of piano. It has a bleary-eyed quality that's reminiscent of The KLF's classic ""Madrugada Eterna,"" but instead of zooming cars on an American highway, it echoes with the distant chirp of birds from the Australian bushland.
 Other tracks on the mini-album could suit the dance floor—or, more appropriately, the afterparty. Before building into a steady rhythm, ""View From The Peak"" warbles with gentle chords layered with a flicker of drums. Something similar happens in ""Tidal River,"" with its shuffling bassline and dabs of late-night piano. ""Sealers Cove"" is the most vigorous of a mild lot, ascending into a groove by the end of its nine-minute length. ""Darby Saddle"" departs from 4/4, with the intermittent rustling of percussion nestled in with warm strings and twinkling keys. The most accessible track, the Balearic-leaning ""Last Light,"" allures with silky saxophone and elegant drums. Tidal River isn't strictly an ambient release, but it's best listened to as one.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22197
Cesare vs Disorder ‎- Ararapira Jazz,Vakant,VA072,"Minimal, House",February 2018,2,3.5,"Minimal has gone through many phases over the years, and Vakant has dabbled in just about all of them. The Berlin label taps Spacetravel, a key producer pushing the style's move into cosmic terrain, for a remix on its latest EP, Cesare vs Disorder's Ararapira Jazz. Spacetravel turns the title track into an ultra-deep groover, little more than a thumping kick, sporadic electroid synth squiggles and frantic claps and hi-hats. The beat is tough, so it feels like the kind of tune best deployed in a party's final stages, when anything more complicated than a straight 4/4 pattern is tough to compute.
 The EP's original three tracks push more familiar minimal sounds. Thanks to a deep, rhythmic bassline, ""Ararapira Jazz"" is the pick of the bunch. Bright but subtle, its main melody is a mix of light chords and sparkling notes, building up and down as the bassline dances underneath. Ricardo Villalobos's influence is heard in the rhythm and vocals of ""Desorientado,"" while ""Dinner With Bogdan"" lays down more cheery synths over another hyperactive bassline. Ararapira Jazz is a great summer record, so let's hope it stays in DJ bags until then.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22265
Various - PGH Electro Vol. 1,Is / Was,IW03,Electro,February 2018,4,3.7,"Several Midwest-based producers have received some well-deserved attention lately. Thanks to killer records from Dwayne Jensen and Chase Smith, the Pittsburgh label Is / Was has been central to this development. Instead of the bounding charm of its first two releases, the PGH Electro Vol. 1 compilation shows a darker side of the Midwest scene, but it feels like a natural continuation from Smith's bouncy electro and acid jams. Hits Only's ""Trion-4"" grabs you with gracefully pirouetting hi-hats, pixelating synth arpeggios and sharp percussion. Feeling like two tracks in one, its first half has a UK techno vibe that slithers into gargling 303s and dizzying synth sequences.  Where the A-side holds tough rhythms with a polished sheen, Shawn Rudiman handles the B-side with the raw sound of modular workouts recorded in his overwhelmingly packed studio. The menacing acid-tinged electro of ""Asimolar"" thumps straight through your body. Rudiman's words in a recent documentary seem to apply here: ""It's like when you're waiting for a wave out in the ocean. You feel it picking up and you think, this is it—I'm riding this to the beach.""",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22174
Loco Dice - Roots,Desolat,DESOLAT060,"Techno, House",February 2018,8,2.9,"With help from his studio partner Martin Buttrich, Loco Dice spent much of the '00s supplementing his flourishing DJ career with a steady run of slick minimal bombs on labels like Ovum, Cadenza and Minus. ""Seeing Through Shadows"" and ""Tight Laces,"" which featured on Dice's excellent debut album, were hits on the world's coolest dance floors. But as his profile ballooned in the early '10s, his output slowed, before completely grinding to a halt around 2012. When he returned three years later with a new album packed with unlikely—and in some cases unfortunate—collaborations, the Dice of old was barely recognisable.  Three years later Dice seems to have had a change of heart. His latest single, ""Roots,"" might not capture the magic of the '00s, but it's far from a slice of cheesy pop-house. The first two minutes, in particular, are solid. A bleepy melody prances over crunchy drums, the groove frisky without overdoing it. Things slip in the second half, as expansive big-room synths, a second melody and the sound of a spring being flicked clutter the composition. The gruff vocal also jars, so reach for the instrumental version. Roots might show Dice back on the right path, but there's still a long way to go.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22264
P. Adrix - Álbum Desconhecido,Principe,P022,"Kuduro, Batida",February 2018,3,4.0,"Lisbon's post-kuduro batida community has churned out young producers since it first gained international recognition around 2013. But as with any newly popular scene, it can eventually become challenging telling artists apart. Enter P. Adrix. At a time when many immigrants are going the opposite direction, the Lisbon-native moved to Manchester three years ago at the tender age of 19.
 There's no telling what the move did to Adrix's music, which definitely has its own flavor. It has the sparseness of his Príncipe contemporaries, albeit with different relationship with bass, reflecting a love of hip-hop or perhaps the soundsystem culture so foundational in the UK. It's booming and elastic in the brief trap breakdown in ""Zelda Shyt"" and the mantric bounce of ""Abertura Da Roda,"" which isn't far from Jersey club. It's a good foundation for earworm flourishes like the woody clicks in ""Estação De Queluz,"" the flutey synths and heavy breathing accents of ""Viva La Raça"" and the sinuous tarraxo groove of ""Sonhos."" Like most post-kuduro batida, Álbum Desconhecido is fun and frantic with an oblong funk that outsiders will have a hard time replicating. For Adrix, the way his music rubs against other styles feels most exciting.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22199
Dengue Dengue Dengue - Son De Los Diablos,Enchufada,ENLP089,Bass,February 2018,2,3.8,"Few producers do percussion like Dengue Dengue Dengue. The Peruvian duo weave dense webs of interconnected grooves, balancing Afro-Latin rhythms and modern bass music. They don't shy away from using long samples or colorful lead melodies, bold songwriting elements that make their tracks feel like more than just DJ tools. They are in play on Son De Los Diablos (""Sound Of The Devils""), their first EP since the 2016 album, Siete Raíces.  The title track is a great example. Rather than going straight in with a percussive groove, they foment a tense mood with violin strokes resonating in negative space. The shakers and hand drums come in bit by bit, and the bass that kicks in at the one-minute mark is so thick that it's alarming. The melodies are almost always simple three- or four-note lines, but they're layered in a way that makes them work. That's especially clear on ""Buscando."" The digital marimba is just a little bit dissonant, making for an ambiguous tone somewhere between ominous and celebratory—a line these two are particularly good at towing. There's a yawning, fantasmic vocal clip (""Estoy buscando,"" or ""I'm searching"") that injects a bit of sadness, too.  ""Flootz"" centers on muffled loops of hand claps and chants tied to an unhurried 4/4 beat that will warm up a dance floor. A spacious mid-range makes it fun to DJ with, leaving plenty of room for incoming and outgoing tracks in the mix. ""Cobre,"" with its flute melodies and spacious reverb, contains whispers of classic dubstep tracks like Skream's ""Rutten,"" though the percussion skips instead of stomping. Son De Los Diablos is no real departure from what we heard on Siete Raíces, but as the old saying goes, if it ain't broke don't fix it.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22192
Philipp Otterbach ‎- Humans,Tour Messier,TM01,Techno,February 2018,Post a comment,3.8,"Humans is a murky and unsettling record. A sense of mystery is its most endearing quality, refusing to give up its secrets no matter how many times you hear it. The EP inaugurates the Dutch label Tour Messier, a new outlet intended for non-dance floor music with hidden depths. Featuring three ambient soundscapes and a groggy beat tune, Humans is the German artist Philipp Otterbach's first full EP. He's released more clubby fare in the past on the Essen/Berlin label Grokenberger Records, but even those tracks had a haunted quality. (Check ""Shake The Shackles,"" a two-part tribal meditation.) Otterbach is a heady producer, and Humans is his most potent collection to date.
 The first three tracks drift through eerie terrain. They're spacious but stifling compositions, filled with a scant few details and the faintest pulse of forward-motion. There are voices muttering to themselves in hushed tones—or are they trying to communicate? ""Mfz1YrpMbBg"" is loaded with shadowy moans, chanting and a female sample that, though inaudible, sounds distressed. Like a horror master, Otterbach only hints at a morbid picture, letting our imaginations do the rest. ""5CnAPD39cUQ"" works all that cinematic drama into a glutinous club track that oozes and glides.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22111
Martyn Bootyspoon - Silk Eternity,Fractal Fantasy,N/A,Club,February 2018,3,3.8,"Dance music can be faceless. It's hard to get a sense of a producer's personality based on the way they arrange their synthesizers, so it's refreshing when someone like Martyn Bootyspoon delivers an EP saturated with charisma. The Montreal artist has almost no prior solo discography, though he's worked with other producers on projects for Fractal Fantasy, the label run by Sinjin Hawke and Zora Jones. On Silk Eternity, he's not only the producer but the master of ceremonies, sermonizing over his own modern club rhythms.  The opening track, ""Spread That Kat,"" sets the tone, with its oversexed lyrics and a barebones drum machine beat that borrows from Night Slugs and Chicago house. ""Steam"" begins like a stripped-back drum track, but it erupts unexpectedly with bright synths that disappear just as quickly. ""The Grid"" is hilarious, with Bootyspoon delivering an erotic monologue about cloud computing and data mining over booming 808 kicks. ""What are you browsing?"" he teases. ""Let's go through your browser history. You browse my Instagram and your data plan is overflowing... with joy."" The seductive tone is reminiscent of '90s spoken-word house tracks, especially naughty ones like Cajmere's ""Chit Chat.""  Speaking of Chicago, it's impressive that Fractal Fantasy wrangled a remix from one of the city's most storied producers, Steve Poindexter, who's only put out a handful of tracks in the last eight years. He straightens the spastic rhythms of ""Spread That Kat"" into a punishing house banger. Not only a peak-time bomb, it's also a clever bit of A&R, considering the original samples Poindexter's classic ""Work That Motherfucker."" On the more abstract ""Helicoptah Dance,"" we hear Bootyspoon's knack for sound design, which comes across through the delicious synth textures. Silk Eternity is a colorful portrait of a larger-than-life character.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22191
Etienne - V3,Sequalog,SEQG003,"Techno, Electro, Minimal",February 2018,1,3.9,"It feels like Etienne has been making music for much longer than his relatively small catalogue suggests. His debut EP, Airmetique, began things in 2015 with techy rollers that had the swing of UK garage. But with skipping claves, claps and disorientating synths, it was his following record for the London-based Undersound Recordings that really launched his minimal sound. V3, Etienne's latest EP, veers in a different direction. In a shift first heard on last year's split EP with TC80, he streamlines some of the elements that characterised Dez, bringing a new dimension to his music.
 There has been an increase in minimal producers adopting the liquid waves of the 303, and Etienne is no exception. ""V3"" guides you through an underwater tunnel where metallic synths and aquatic acid sounds merge with a hefty kick, short claps and clacking hi-hats. The record glides along at a steady pace until ""Halycon""'s frantic stomp throws us into a peak-time dance floor, after which ""Azur"" cools the temperature with glacial pads that signal that the end of the night may be near.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22119
S & M Trading Co. - Metal Surface Repair,Fit,FIT019,"House, Techno",February 2018,2,3.7,"DJ Sotofett and Aaron ""FIT"" Siegel have worked together, on some level, for years. They've toured Europe as a duo, hosted each other at parties in Detroit and Berlin, remixed tracks and jammed together in various configurations. They've also managed to log some hours in Siegel's studio, housed in the pivotal US dance music store and distributor Submerge. It was only a matter of time until FIT and Sotofett launched an official collaborative project. Their debut as S & M Trading Co. was recorded way back in 2011, with each producer chipping away at the final versions in the years since.
 Siegel and Sotofett have a knack for crafting tracks with an epic scope. ""Metal Surface Repair"" fits the bill, cycling through three movements over the course of ten minutes. The melancholic intro recalls FIT's breakthrough track, ""Carmine,"" and low-key Detroit classics like Model 500's ""Pick Up The Flow."" After traversing a knotty, acidic middle section, we're treated to a gorgeous ambient techno resolve. A two-note 303 line complements Sotofett's loose, dubby percussion as skyward synths bring home the pensive, optimistic mood.  If you don't feel like waiting six minutes for that payoff, flip the record for the ""Synthetic Mix,"" an ambient version of ""Metal Surface Repair'""s stunning conclusion. Like Sotofett's recent collaboration with LNS, the ""Soft Peak Mix,"" the ambient piece is a winning gesture towards Artificial Intelligence-era influences. Metal Surface Repair is stuffed with ideas, but the best track off the duo's promising debut is its simplest.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22193
Aalko - No Man Is An Island,Kebko Music,KEB004,"Electronic, Techno, Experimental",January 2018,Post a comment,3.8,"Akiko Kiyama has made the weirdest music of her career during the past two years. From 2004 till 2015, her EPs and LPs surfaced on the sort of labels—Contexterrior, Lick My Deck, District Of Corruption—and mixes—most notably Richie Hawtin's DE9 | Transitions—you'd expect of a solid minimal techno producer. It's much harder to describe what Kiyama, as Aalko, is doing on No Man Is An Island. A three-track sampler from an album of the same name, the EP follows a series of experimental records on Kebko Music, the label Kiyama set up two years ago, where oddball composition has reigned, most notably on her excellent 2015 LP, Ophelia.
 ""Body & Soul""'s drum track is slashed in vandalising strokes by toms, flatulent synths, squeezed latex and anything else that will halt the rhythm. (A tongue-in-cheek bass guitar lick is the track's only constant.) ""Mixture"" is similarly unsettled. The breakbeats are thinly sliced, and often cut out suddenly. The percussion, a mix of live drum sounds and machine-derived claps and hats, is arranged in disjunctive, overlapping patterns. ""Mixture""s disorderly vibe is brought out by a digital slide whistle, which is both funny and annoying. If these arrhythmic stretches have limited appeal for fans of her old stuff, then the dub techno of ""B.I.C."" is a fine reminder of Kiyama's dance floor pedigree.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22188
Flow ‎- Trine,Tardis,TAR008,"Tech House, House",February 2018,10,4.2,"Recent EPs from artists like The Persuader and Losoul have seen Tardis push a deep and dubby sound suited to warm-up sets and afterhours. Trine, featuring three tracks produced in the '90s by the revered but little-known UK tech house artist Flow, puts the label back in the realm of peak-time DJs. The highlight is ""Boy Girl Action,"" a ten-minute house bomb that occupies the full A-side. It's built around a monster bassline that would take over a room if played through the right soundsystem, pitching up and down as snappy percussion skips above. The mood is serious but the groove is strong, buoyed by twisted licks of synth and vocals calling out from deep within the mix. There's no breakdown and the energy stays high for the full ten minutes, making this a tune you could play from beginning to end if the placement is right.  The two B-side tunes aim for different moods. ""Trine"" is introspective and vaguely positive, employing a bold bassline and shuffling drums. Its wailing female vocal, clipped from an unknown source, captures the sound of '90s rave, as do the cosmic pads that give the track a sentimental touch. An easygoing groove makes ""I See You"" the most versatile tune. There isn't a clear melody, so vocoder vocals and a ghostly whisper supply the colour, gliding atop yet another fat bassline. Already picked up by DJs like Ricardo Villalobos and Dorian Paic, it won't be long until Trine blows a hole in a dance floor near you.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22249
Paradox - The Bolide / Dioxan,Paradox Music,PM035,Drum & Bass,January 2018,1,3.9,"In the field of breakology, Paradox is a by-word for quality. He takes sample-choppage to connoisseur levels but rarely descends into mindless ""watch this"" pyrotechnics. Realism and flow are the priorities, which makes his measured rhythmic interventions all the more effective. In the past few years, he's even released two 12-inches of breaks for other producers to sample, tying drum & bass back to its roots in b-boying and hip-hop culture along the way. So it's no surprise that The Bolide / Dioxan is staunchly classicist in its approach. But despite containing go-to Paradox sounds, it feels oddly of the moment, which is a testament to the energy that powers his work.
 Martial arts is a common metaphor in drum & bass but it's the best way to describe what's going on in ""The Bolide."" The breaks offer a series of taut parries and jabs but the magic happens when they swerve out of range at the end of every few phrases. These short gaps are filled with barely there atmospheres or looming subs, which give strength to the impending strike rushing into the downbeat. This physical language evolves as the track continues, regulating the energy and switching pressure points as it calmly builds. As the vibe resets at the halfway point, you're offered a moment of respite, a much-needed chance to put the pieces back together.  ""Dioxan"" is the standout. The breaks are more restrained but there's detail hidden below the surface. Every few snare drums hit with a shifting timbre—you can literally hear how the stick knocks the rim and skin in slightly different ways. But it's the vocal samples asking if ""y'all ready?"" that really up the ante, along with subs that fall from punchy dub-school lines into deeper, sustained frequencies. It's textbook Paradox, but after two decades in the game, he remains a gold-standard.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22168
Old Tower - Stellary Wisdom,Profound Lore Records,PFL198,"Dungeon Synth, Ambient",February 2018,Post a comment,3.6,"Dungeon synth, a backdated term for the goofy pseudo-orchestral synth music that black metal musicians made in the '90s, has become the subject of renewed attention. Several producers without ties to metal now make music in the style, including Northern Electronics founder Anthony Linell. Old Tower is another standout from this new wave. The Dutch producer has created an immersive world that emphasises the best parts of the style. Using track titles like ""Deep Within My Somber Castle Halls,"" his music evokes the typical imagery of dungeon synth—courtly rituals, lonely medieval fortresses, the clammy cold of stone buildings—without indulging in the faux-Renaissance melodies or junky Casio sonics of its most predictable tracks.
 Stellary Wisdom is Old Tower's debut on Profound Lore, a forward-thinking metal label also home to experimental artists like Prurient. The 12-inch features two side-long compositions. ""Deep Within My Somber Castle Halls"" will be familiar to dungeon synth heads, painting rudimentary melodies with rich brush strokes. ""Stellary Wisdom"" is where the magic happens. It's a long, textured drone that changes between thin and thick across 15 minutes. This detailed, kosmische-like approach makes the music feel as eerie as the artwork and concepts it comes with. So much of the style relies on clichés to transport the listener to the Dark Ages, but Old Tower shows how texture and atmosphere can evoke that mood—and how gripping it can be.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22172
Orbe - Laser's Worldwar,Palinoia,PALINOIA003,"Techno, House",January 2018,6,4.0,"Madrid's Orbe label describes itself as ""a trip without beginning or end."" Orbe, the man behind it, lives up to the promise on his debut for Eric Cloutier's Palinoia. Balancing techno's otherworldly hypnotism with the cushioning suppleness of house, this is music for the dance floor's deepest nether hours, when the body can barely keep moving and the mind is far away. A relatively fresh face in Spanish techno, Orbe gauges the mood expertly, delivering four elegant arrangements.
 ""Device's Generation"" and ""Laser's Worldwar"" are Jeff Mills panoramas with a seductive sway, their star canopies of dissonant synths streaked by passing comets of melody, chord and percussion. A pad line that slides drunkenly in pitch makes ""Upper Stage"" more playful, while looped voices that hover just out of focus add more intrigue. The music's soft side surfaces on ""Cosmic Creed,"" where tuneful keys and purls of bright melody replace atonal synth lines. The drums also have more kinesis, thanks to bouncy hi-hats and the occasional claps. Subtle touches give this music its twilit drama.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22123
Iron Curtis - Unwind,Polytone,PLTR015,"House, Ambient",February 2018,Post a comment,3.4,"Iron Curtis, AKA Johannes Paluka, is among a handful of artists who made a name for themselves during the German deep house heyday of the late '00s and early '10s. Along with producers associated with labels like Smallville and WHITE, he emerged with a linear but lush sound suited to smoke-filled rooms welcoming the night's first dancers. Paluka's profile has dipped in the meantime, but his new Unwind EP shows that he still knows how to craft effective deep house.  Of the EP's three original tracks, two are for the dance floor. ""Unwind"" is the deeper option, with a snappy beat and occasional licks of synth. Thanks to a hyperactive bassline, ""Riders"" is more energetic, shuffling its way to an extended breakdown that feels too ambitious for the track's twilit mood. ""Cream,"" a celestial ambient track, is the EP's nicest moment, a four-minute respite from the chugging drums found across the rest of the EP. Any house DJ responsible for warming up a room should find use for Unwind, a record with a sound that could transport you back to 2011.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22247
Secondcity & George Smeddles - Can You Feel It EP,Sola Records,N/A,Tech House,February 2018,2,2.3,"A vocal sample can go a long way in house music, which is something Secondcity knows well. ""I Wanna Feel,"" a track featuring snatches from a Toni Braxton tune, topped the UK charts in 2014 thanks to its uplifting vocal refrain. Secondcity's latest effort, a collaboration with George Smeddles, uses a cheaper version of the same trick. This time it's a vocal from ""Bam Bam,"" the legendary reggae track by Sister Nancy. But where ""I Wanna Feel"" chopped and rearranged Toni Braxton's lyrics over a warm piano house beat, ""Can You Feel It"" loops a section of Sister Nancy's patois over derivative big-room tech house. Secondcity and Smeddles aren't the first artists to sample ""Bam Bam,"" and their version feels rushed, hinged on an obvious sample with no relationship to the music it's paired with.
 ""Groove Is In"" takes a slightly more creative approach to sampling. The vocal is edited and rearranged atop another lean beat, but the extra work pays off. The same big-room markers—white noise, drum rolls, breakdowns—are there, but the mood is livelier. That said, this doesn't save the EP, a release where even the track titles feel uninspired. Secondcity has proven to be a crafty sampler, so it's a shame Can You Feel It falls flat.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22245
Neana - Evaser,Night Slugs,NS028,"House, Club",January 2018,3,3.3,"Neana has been affiliated with Night Slugs since 2013, though aside from two white label bootlegs, he's never had his own release on the label. The London producer makes a promising debut on Evaser, cloaking Night Slugs' lean brand of club music in satin textures and day-glo colours.
 Neana's music sits somewhere between grime and ballroom. Tracks like ""Tell Her"" and ""Neans Anthem"" make conspicuous use of ballroom's exaggerated stabs, though where some producers might relish in the genre's violent spasms, Neana softens the blow. On the triumphant ""Neans Anthem,"" he layers melodies like a woven basket, making your focus move to the leads and whirring samples, not the pounding drums. The same goes for ""Cruz Control,"" where a giddy melody pirouettes like the Knight Rider theme caught in a whirlpool, while even the starker ""Fidelity"" is overloaded with samples of animals growling and squawking. Neana's music is lavish and crammed with ideas, but it sometimes lacks the characteristics of the best Night Slugs records: the push-and-pull between quiet and loud, and the tension that can make a room blow at any second.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22126
Various - Anonymous Delusional Eros,Nous,US017,Techno,January 2018,4,3.9,"Nous has a knack for signing excellent tracks from relatively unknown artists. Just look at the Berlin-based label's last compilation EP, 2016's #3. It featured the killer ""Spring Ballade,"" from a then unknown Anastasia Kristensen, a tribal techno slammer from the low-profile Dreams and striking vinyl debuts from Ayln and Mauvais Art. Two of these artists return on the label's new compilation, which was originally a Rush Hour exclusive for last year's ADE.
 Ayln opens the release with the coolly syncopated ""Translinguistic,"" while Dreams closes with the glowering ""What We Become."" Both tracks recall Bristolian soundsystem techno—the former isn't miles away from Asusu, the latter could be Kowton-meets-Ploy—as well as UK-loving Euro techno institutions like Ilian Tape. They set the tone for the record, on which a spread of lesser-known artists explore syncopated grooves, heads-down moods and DJ-friendly arrangements with the occasional flash of flair.
 To continue the comparison game, D104's inky ""Muta"" is a bit like Forest Drive West in tribal techno mode. Debutant Agxp goes for a softer mood on ""Spells,"" whose lilting rhythm is offset with divebombing bass, while Sweat's ""Shalbatana"" livens droning technoid hypnosis with unexpectedly bright chord stabs. In the middle, Gaunt—of Beneath's Mistry label—releases this simmering tension on ""Univers Univers."" Save for the occasional skip in its grubby house step, it's rhythmically straighter than the others, but its layers of swirling atmosphere build to a surprisingly intense climax.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22121
Unknown - Unknown,EEE,EEE002,Minimal,February 2018,7,2.7,"There's a thin line between homage and laziness, and it's hard to say where the second release on the edits label EEE sits. This uncredited single-sided 12-inch holds an extended edit of Depeche Mode's ""Little 15,"" a nifty synth-pop track originally released in 1988. The edit has appeared in DJ sets from Ricardo Villalobos and other minimal DJs for the past few years, and while the producer's name isn't displayed on the vinyl, it's widely known to be Priku. Pairing the original's distinctive organ-style melody with a standard minimal beat, it's about as straightforward as edits get. The hook is a catchy snippet clipped from the original's introduction, which Priku loops for 12 minutes. We get the original's vocals and a few extra percussive elements, but that's about it.
 And that's the problem. EEE002 may be a fine DJ tool, but it's the kind of track that should have been given away for free on SoundCloud, not sold for €12 a pop as a one-sided vinyl. After all, Depeche Mode riffs would sound great over just about any beat, making this is a 12-inch dance music could have done without.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22235
Theo Parrish - Preacher's Comin,Sound Signature,SS071,House,January 2018,8,4.1,"""Gullah man, Geechee woman / introduced to the North American continent / by way of evil landing."" ""Gullah Geechee""'s spoken word is a primer on the dialect, history, tradition and folklore of the Gullah and Geechee people, descendants of West African slaves who live on the Georgia and South Carolina sea islands. That might seem like sober fare for a house record, but Theo Parrish and his collaborators—Carolyn Ferrari, Craig Huckaby, Jovia Armstrong and Keith Beber—tell the story with a sharp wit and an easy musical sense.
 ""Gullah Geechee""'s craftiest trick might be its vocal layering. As the quartet's clap-chorus combination thrums underneath, Huckaby and Ferrari go back and forth with additional verses, alternately celebratory and sardonic. (""Say our language is broken English / but we speak whole African adapted for a new land,"" goes one line.) This layering sounds like it would be easy to get wrong, but the chorus remains both unobtrusive and completely vital. A wriggling bassline and stubby Rhodes keys support the rhythm, but it's the claps and vocals that give it life.
 ""Preacher's Comin"" eases into a classic sample-based Theo Parrish sound. The honky-tonk piano vamps give it a ragtime twist, with a repeating vocal—""preacher's comin'""—that dictates the track's ebb and flow. It's one of Parrish's strongest A-sides in a while, but ""Gullah Geechee"" is a shade better—rivalled only by ""Footwork"" and ""Long Walk In Your Sun,"" it's among the most distinctive tracks of his recent catalogue.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22185
D'Julz ‎- Remixes,Bass Culture,BCR054T,"House, Deep House",January 2018,Post a comment,3.5,"Bass Culture has been a go-to label for understated house music for the best part of a decade. Alongside the likes of Robsoul, Lazare Hoche and Varhat, it's one of a handful of outlets and producers pushing the style in Paris, a city with a special relationship with slick and functional sounds. Bass Culture's latest EP collects four remixes from Houdini, a 2015 EP from D'Julz, the label's founder. From spacey to razor-sharp, each delivers a different take on a reduced aesthetic, combining for a 12-inch that would be a great addition to any house DJ's bag.  Your preferred remix will likely depend on the type of dance floors you play to. The rework of ""Serendipity"" by the Romanian producer MP is the release's most reduced track, little more than a bassline, shuffling percussion and faint synth squiggles. It would be a risky track to unleash on a busy dance floor, so save this one for the afterparty. DJ Skull and Sebo K display a veteran's touch on their respective remixes, both bottom-heavy rollers with jazzy basslines and just the right amount of melody. Henrik Bergqvist, a versatile DJ whose sets take in everything from house to electro, goes spacey on his rework of ""Waiting 4 Visa,"" sprinkling cosmic details over a fat bassline and a snappy beat.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22186
Frank Bretschneider - Plastik / Mechanik,Shitkatapult,STRIKE167,"House, Techno, IDM",January 2018,3,3.6,"Frank Bretschneider's sprawling experimental discography conveys a lifelong fascination with sound design, but every so often his love of rhythm comes to the fore. Take 2007's aptly titled LP, Rhythm, or, more recently, Super.Trigger, which saw the Raster-Noton cofounder turn his hand to gnarly glitchtronica. If the preview EP for his forthcoming full-length, Lunik, is anything to go on, the new album also sits in this tougher, more accessible style.  Plastik / Mechanik features two tracks, both of which show Bretschneider in the brightest and funkiest form of his career. ""Plastik"" is melodic and downbeat, with single notes of candescent synths panning from left to right over a bassy, low-key breakbeat. It's pretty and absorbing in its repetition, but it could use some extra shifts to justify its six-minute runtime. The shorter and more direct ""Mechanik"" is a rare example of Bretschneider producing with half an eye on the dance floor. The woody kicks don't exactly bang, but there's enough funk and thrust in the motorized synth line to get bodies gently grooving. Again, the beauty is getting lost in the loop.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22171
Ashtar Lavanda - Ashtar Lavanda,Ultramajic,LVX034,"Electro, Techno",February 2018,7,2.6,"Who is Ashtar Lavanda? An ancient deity? An alien that sends messages to UFO truthers? Or a diamond-in-the-rough Detroit electro producer who made music in the '90s that never saw the light of day? Ultramajic says it's that last one. This record, the first from Ashtar Lavanda, comes with notes explaining that Jimmy Edgar found this music on DAT tapes, dated from 1995 to 1998, in a storage unit in East Michigan. Ultramajic compares the recordings to mid-'90s classics from artists like Drexciya, AUX 88 and Ectomorph, creating impossible expectations for an EP that turns out to be derivative electro.
 Judging from the tracks on this self-titled EP, Ashtar Lavanda is more of a competent impersonator than a forgotten genius. The first four tunes emulate the sound of early Drexciya until the only impression the thrusting rhythms and staccato melodies leave is a vague nostalgia. (The shouted vocals on ""Moth"" feel like a homage to the Drexciya track ""Take Your Mind."") ""Gratiot Shake,"" another outlier, sounds more like a Jimmy Edgar track than anything from the mid-'90s, so you'd be forgiven for having doubts about this release. And that's the problem with Ashtar Lavanda, an EP with a story more interesting than its music. Only ""Unsolved Mysteries,"" a kooky and off-kilter jam, offers something to perk up your ears.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22167
Pinch - Walking With Shadows / Ahh Fff Sss,Swamp 81,PMAWS014,Bass,February 2018,4,3.7,"Pinch has made a banger or two in his time, but his best recent tracks tend towards restraint and glowering stasis. Take ""Strobe Light"" with Mumdance, which offered a moment of floaty repose in many sets late last year. Or the weightless gqom-meets-grime menacer ""Cold New World."" Or ""Brain Scan,"" a pitter-patter of sci-fi drums over slow-mo low-end. It's a similar deal on the Bristol artist's return to Swamp81—home to one of his bigger '10s hits, ""Croydon House""—after a half-decade absence.  The brooding ""Walking With Shadows"" steals the show. With painterly drums and sparse bass, it sounds like an intro. The track's elegant halftime rhythms, weaving their way through rippling pads, gradually build to a beat, but Pinch shuts things down before they get out of hand. The B-side, ""Ahh Fff Sss,"" similarly keeps its cool. Pinch sneaks in the ""Anasthasia"" stab—a canonical rave sound that could easily signal dance floor mayhem—but it's kept on a tight leash, sounding out against a greyscale backdrop of chord clusters and reverb-cloaked atmospherics. There is a sterner dance floor rudder to this one, a tense arrangement of claps, snares and flickering hi-hats that doesn't quite gel into a pulse-raising groove.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22088
Ex-Terrestrial - Portal Vision,NAFF,NAFF001,"House, Deep House",January 2018,7,4.0,"Adam Feingold's music has changed at an arresting pace. He started out making hard-edged techno under his own name, but once he turned to Ex-Terrestrial the tunes became lighter and more expansive. The first EP, released back in 2016, hinted at '90s electronica, a sound Feingold has revisited since. Portal Vision, the first release on NAFF, a new label started by Feingold and fellow Montrealer Francis Latreille, refines the formula even further, mixing IDM atmospherics with the groovy house sound that dominates Canada coast-to-coast.
 ""Vanilight,"" which appears in a version retouched by Priori, AKA Latreille, is the obvious highlight. A disco bassline walks underneath a collage of keyboard chords and gentle pads, using elements of '90s chillout to build something more current. Two versions of ""Portal Vision"" walk a similar tightrope between contemporary and throwback. The ""Plain"" version is house daubed with watery samples and buried kalimba loops—à la Mood Hut—while the ""Kalimba"" mix puts the instrument at the front, creating a house-not-house groove similar to those found in the mid-'80s. The odd track out is ""2DS,"" which steps from the eerie light into humid rainforest atmospherics. With its laid-back amble and chintzy MIDI saxophone, it exists in the same Canadian funkmosphere as the rest of the EP, rounding off a record that puts a personal spin on an increasingly ubiquitous approach to house music.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22166
Krust - The Portal / Concealed Treachery,31 Records,31RS031,Drum & Bass,January 2018,4,4.1,"By the end of the '90s, Krust was ""making art and not music."" Alien steppers like ""Warhead"" turned young listeners into drum & bass devotees, but it was tracks like ""Soul In Motion"" that reflected Krust's expansive artistic goals. Running over ten minutes long, it's drum & bass on an epic scale, pairing inventive sound design with brutally minimal drum programming. But after a period of major label interest, Krust stepped back from the scene, finding another life in the advertising industry. We weren't expecting new material anytime soon, but even more surprising is that The Portal / Concealed Treachery, his first solo release in over a decade, is so good.  Krust masterfully builds tension on the title track. He plays with your attention in austere fashion, each sound appearing at just the right time. There's the distant burst of spacecraft thrust, which gently fades into a garble of futuristic brass. A dormant sub sporadically raises its head in a plume of sizzling overtones before making way for a satisfying synth sound that can best be described as a donk. When rippling harps and a whisper-quiet pad appear in the middle third, you don't even realise they've altered the mood. They gently lay a beautiful springboard for a Blade Runner-style lead, which casts graceful arcs across the lonely scene.  ""Concealing Treachery"" is just as good, coming off like a chance meeting between Christoph De Babalon and Objekt. Like the A-side, it takes place in a hyperreal synthetic world. Although the drums are more syncopated, the groove is similarly light on its feet, aquaplaning across the dance like a hydrofoil. The way the track progresses is ultra-specific, so it feels like Krust spent a lot of time working on the subtle narrative. He has called this 12-inch ""the beginning of something."" If he can maintain this standard, it'll be one of the strongest comebacks in drum & bass history.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22161
Avatism - Bad Summer,Parachute,PAR020,Techno,February 2018,4,3.2,"After releasing his debut album in 2013, Thomas Feriero stepped away from Avatism to focus on projects with Francesco Leali. They set up Parachute Records (with DJ Tennis) and began fleshing out their experimental techno collaboration, CW/A. Feriero left the sleek minimal sound of his early Avatism releases and widened his pool of influences to include breakbeat, jungle, IDM and industrial techno. He has always favoured melodies, which have lately grown cold, dissonant and unsettling. The malaise deepens on Bad Summer, Feriero's first Avatism EP for Parachute Records.
 Rusty percussion shreds through the sombre veil on ""Bad Summer,"" which is weighted down further with heavy bass and synths. The sullen ""Clandestine"" is less of a drag but too emulative of the IDM-jungle formula established by acts like Squarepusher and Lakker. The B-side is stronger. ""Outrospection"" morphs with subtle ease, with syncopated rhythms, a piercing melody line and hissing jungle snares. It's one of Feriero's better Avatism productions. ""Rassvet"" is stylishly unrefined, with wild dynamics, an overbearing crescendo and noodley synth details. But it's still lush and fluid, with the makings of a fine signature sound.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22156
Nightwave - Sanctuary,Fool's Gold,N/A,"House, Techno, Trap",February 2018,1,3.7,"Like many of her Glaswegian peers, Maya Medvešek is a great party DJ. She's not afraid to throw down classics or push the boundaries of taste, tendencies that have seeped into her productions. Her first release on Fool's Gold, Wavejumper, featured Drexciya-inspired electro and grime projected through the lens of modern trap and club music. For Limelight, she turns to classic house and rave music, refurbishing old-school styles for modern festival stages.
 The hardcore influence is most obvious on ""Fantazia"" and ""Limelight."" Featuring a vocal from Medvešek, ""Limelight"" is especially excellent, hurtling between chunky house and funky hardcore. And while she's great at reproducing these sounds, her big-room production style really brings the tracks to life. That's why the breakbeat hardcore of ""Fantasia"" sounds fresh, not nostalgic.
 Across the rest of Sanctuary Medvešek goes somewhere else altogether. The title track is manic club music, where needlepoint strings spar with drums that pop up at random places like a game of whack-a-mole. ""Tarmac"" is even more out-there. Medvešek twists EDM-style trap with constant left turns and a trigger-happy grip on the hi-hats. Each track offers a different spin on how to rock a dance floor.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22162
#4.26 - Mono Middle,Marcel Dettmann Records,MDR024,Techno,February 2018,5,3.6,"When Dario Zenker christened the #4.26 alias in 2010, the Ilian Tape label he ran with his brother Marco was still hitting its stride. They were only just getting back to vinyl releases after a digital-only spell to pay off distributor debts, and their trademark sound was still crystallising. You can hear this sound—or Dario's spin on it, at least—taking shape across the five #4.26 records he released on Frozen Border until 2013. (The records were released anonymously at first—the alias is Zenker's initials in Frozen Border's letters-to-numbers code.) A pair of early 12-inches were relatively faceless dub techno, while later ones gained mass, melodic drama and broken beat spice. By now the Ilian sound is firmly lodged in the techno consciousness, and Zenker doesn't mess with it on this revival of the pseudonym for MDR.
 The record could be a partner piece to last year's EP on Ilian Tape. ""Trivin""'s foghorn bass resurfaces on the excellent ""Whenever Voi"" as a subterranean rumble under wistful halftime drums. Elsewhere, sandpaper surfaces, rugged grooves and streaks of grubby euphoria mark these tracks out as Zenker's. We get a broad spectrum of moods, including various shades of club tool caught between pensive and banging. There's ""Mono Middle,"" which slowly cranks up the energy, and ""Van Cul,"" which wants for a bit of development over its static five minutes. There's also a peak-time slammer, ""Free Upload,"" where Zenker pares his sound back to its ruthless looping core. And then there's the sweet beatless track, ""Past Vibration,"" which does indeed sound like something from the past—the theme tune from an old public information broadcast, maybe.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22164
K15 - Sunbeams,Eglo,EGLO58,Deep House,January 2018,3,3.9,"Kieron Ifill's K15 project has touched on various soulful genres over the years. He's as likely to churn out J Dilla-influenced hip-hop beats or jazzy improv as he is the lush house that he's best known for. Ifill's new 10-inch for Eglo, Sunbeams, represents a landmark point in his evolution, showing he now has the chops to make the jazzy broken beat that has influenced him all along.
 On ""Sunbeams,"" which comes in just under four minutes, a sprightly Rhodes progression is anchored by tribal percussion that recalls Blaze Team's awesome ""Who Can Luv U?"" Ifill layers on bright synth solos and some convincing jazz comping while retaining the ""Deep Burnt""-style atmosphere that has been the trademark of his house tracks. The mix of hand percussion and deft keyboard continues on ""Starburst 3,"" which ups the tempo to almost 140 BPM and evokes Ifill's inspirations like Dego and Domu. Ifill also sounds more comfortable than ever behind the keys on ""Esencia,"" achieving a Roy Ayers-style warmth and depth as he solos madly on the Rhodes. Producers like Ifill spend thousands of hours in the studio, sampling and deconstructing masterful recordings. It's beautiful when they develop the skills to make their own.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22169
December - 64 Ways To Rob A Friend,Return To Disorder,RTTD009,"EBM, Techno",January 2018,Post a comment,3.7,"If you live in Paris, as Tomas More does, then December is when the days are shortest and the sunlight scantiest. It's a neat alias for an artist whose stylishly grim productions have appeared on Mannequin, In Paradisum and Jealous God. There are different kinds of dark, however. More's techno-informed takes on EBM and industrial have often been anti-socially scuffed and distorted, rich in mood but not ideal for a dance floor. These tracks for Helena Hauff's Return To Disorder, by contrast, are commanding, full-frequency and slamming when they want to be. They're perfect fodder, in other words, for Hauff's sets, which bring the dark and dangerous onto big stages.
 More hasn't radically changed the ingredients of his music to make this transformation. Charcoal textures, skulking grooves and imperious spoken vocals remain the recipe. ""64 Ways To Rob A Friend"" delivers them at a stiff-limbed 140 BPM. The drums are lacerating and the mix bruised with distortion, but the whole thing stays somehow light-footed and playful. The mood curdles on the B-side. ""A Place To Stay"" is claustrophobic, a stampede of drums and yammering EBM bass that doesn't let up for eight minutes. In between the two, ""90 Feelings"" offers some breathing space—the drums retreat to a slouching halftime, More's voice to a malicious whisper—but no let-up in mood. The days won't get lighter for a while yet.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22122
Leif - Bluebird / Number 13,TIO-Series,TIOS2,"Deep House, Leftfield",February 2018,8,4.3,"As time goes on, Leif Knowles continually refines the lush and psychedelic sound that's very much his own. For an idea of where he's at as a DJ, listen to his set from last year at Freerotation, where he's a resident. For his best productions, it's a toss-up between July V / Shoulders Back, the first 10-inch on his Tio Series, and its follow-up, Bluebird / Number 13.
 Trippy as they are, both tracks are playful and somehow innocent—rather than a lurid afterhour, you might imagine, say, a festive gathering of adorable forest spirits (or maybe that's just me). Despite its high tempo (138 BPM), ""Bluebird"" rides a lazy, seesawing groove, its twinkling melody framed by percussion that shimmers with delay. ""Number 13"" moves with a bubbling motion, its bassline gurgling up like a hot spring. As with ""Bluebird,"" the lead is a winding 16th-note melody, but this one clones itself in a repeating pattern of call-and-response, first in a higher octave, then with a more percussive sound in the lower mid-range. Both are defined by dazzling textures and nimble rhythms, a combination at the heart of most of Knowles' music, but that here feels closer than ever to perfection.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22165
Takaaki Itoh ‎- Disciplinary Synthetics,Mord,MORD047,Techno,January 2018,Post a comment,3.6,"Takaaki Itoh's Disciplinary Synthetics EP has a nifty balance between new and old school sounds. There's the deep and psychedelic side of tracks like ""Wisher"" and ""Obliger,"" modern-sounding techno tunes that would hypnotise a dance floor. Then there's ""Anagrammer,"" a blistering weapon that couples the rawness of '90s UK techno with precision percussion and a well-sculpted low-end. It's no surprise that Itoh can blend eras and sounds so naturally: he's been producing for over 20 years.  The EP's highlight, ""Wisher,"" was picked up by plenty of DJs, and is among RA's most-charted tracks of January. A fairly standard but effective tool, its kick drum sets a steady pace among a collage of synths that whir and bleep. The sound will be familiar to followers of Northern Electronics and Semantica Records, labels that favour depth over immediacy. While the syncopated ""Obliger"" hovers in a similar zone, the stomping ""Anagrammer"" is more forceful, channelling golden-era Birmingham techno with its elastic lead synth. Funky and ice-cold, it recalls the intensity of early Regis tracks like ""Allies"" and ""Sand.""

Junes - Circuit Rift,Galdoors,GAL009,"Deep House, Minimal",February 2018,2,3.8,"Galdoors is among the best labels going for a particular type of club record: thumping but understated, with smooth and kinetic grooves, the kind of thing that's catnip for warm-up or afterhours. They've approached this sound a few different ways, at times drawing from the trippy end of the UK spectrum (Leif, Duckett, Elgato), at others going for a more minimal-minded style of deep house (Audio Werner). In his own records for the label, Junes, who runs Galdoors with his brother Tames, started in the first camp and gravitated toward the second, gradually homing in on a sleek, punchy and dreamlike style of house. He nails this sound more than ever on his latest 12-inch, Circuit Rift.  ""Circuit Rift"" and ""Awake"" are classic Junes, full of immaculate drums set to nimble rhythms within spacious, ethereal atmospheres. Here, though, the moods are richer and more evocative than on his past records. Ghostly, cinematic strings add depth and tension to the title track. Subtle drum rolls and cool-breeze synths give ""Awake"" an upbeat sense of clarity that suits its name. ""Brass Hand"" has sharper teeth, with a thwacking beat and sinister 16th-note chime melody. What really sells all three though is the tidiness of the drums. It's hard to beat the simple satisfaction of a crisp, well-placed clap.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22151
Persuasion - Quatermass EP,Black Opal,BOP014,"Techno, House",January 2018,Post a comment,3.7,"Montreal's Devon Hansen has used a few names in his time. Persuasion replaces Stefan Jós, the alias under which his music took on dance floor shapes. The new project's debut EP, for Opal Tapes' vinyl wing, leads smoothly on from the 2015 Jós releases for Flau. It has the same twilit moods, the same woody percussion and the same teasing grooves, which use micro-detail to unsettle—rather than enhance—the flow. Hansen has streamlined this sound, where the tempo has snuck up into the 120s and the mixdowns have more air and depth. The reboot is particularly noticeable on the pacy ""Damask Silk."" If there was more boom to its kick drum and a bit more sizzle in the hi-end, it could be warehouse techno. Not that that's desirable; as it is the music hovers in a blurry between-space, soft but commanding.
 That track is dark and withdrawn, its eerie synths suggesting a musique concrète influence. Elsewhere Hansen permits sentimentality in the form of glimmering chords that skulk in the music's shadows. The effect is most striking on ""Xaviera,"" and the same technique is used with more restraint on ""In The Atrium"" and ""Quatermass."" The latter track might be the EP's weakest, thanks to slightly flatter drum programming and a mixdown that pumps uneasily with compression. This might prevent the track from speaking on a loud soundsystem, but it matches the mood—one of end-of-the-night redemption glimpsed but not yet grasped.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22163

It's also a tune for big moments, something that DJs at ://about blank provide plenty of. With a rumbling low-end and heavy kick, the ""ZKB Taking The Bus Version"" of ""Hot Lies"" by the Austrian producer Egon Elliut is similarly ambitious, piling whistles and piano stabs onto a snaking acid line.

HKE - Charming Devil,Dream Catalogue,DREAM137,"Pop, Rock, Hardvapour, Experimental",January 2018,1,4.0,"Last year David Russo said that due to his struggle with depression, he was relinquishing control of his label Dream Catalogue, but things didn't go to plan. It released four massive compilations and then went silent for months. In the last few weeks, the label shot back to life with five new releases, the most intriguing of which comes from Russo under his main alias, HKE. Charming Devil isn't a return to dreamy ambient or sleek techno—it's a dark and desperate descent into anger and self-hatred, expressed through explosive percussion and moody vocals.
 Last year Russo recorded a deflated cover of Puddle Of Mudd's ""Blurry,"" a move that seems prescient now. The first half of Charming Devil is made mostly from looping guitar leads and Russo's iffy but wrenchingly honest singing. He has a surprising knack for guitar riffs, which makes the shift in sound feel natural on tracks like ""William The Conqueror"" and ""Lobotomy."" Things get desperate on ""Mantra,"" where Russo chants ""I'm the devil"" over pounding hardvapour drums, while ""The Earth Is Covered In Blood"" is a fried noise-folk jam that sounds like it was painful to make.
 Charming Devil does open up after its searing beginning. ""No Sleep"" introduces a funky tabla groove, while ""Mini Sync"" sounds like it could be Tin Man on Livity Sound. Those two tracks are separated by ""Wolf,"" a brutal hardvapour jam with weary melodies that creak with pain. But through all these mood shifts and dour moments, Russo's skill for melody comes to the surface, revealing a new side to an already multi-faceted artist.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22109
Lost Trax - The Saturnian System / The Sequel,Delsin,DSRX11,"Techno, Electro, Acid House",December 2017,2,3.7,"Delsin has a knack for releasing records from the past that sound like the present. These records tend to come from underrated figures, and the anonymous collective Lost Trax fits Delsin's intergalactic sound. The Saturnian System / The Sequel collects music that appeared on releases from 2006 and 2010, compiling four tracks that push the collective's signature aesthetic.
 There's a desolate sadness to the EP, where even the basslines on ""The Sequel"" and ""Self Destruct Sequence"" frown between tear-jerking chords. The Saturnian System / The Sequel showcases the group's self-described ""emotional music, straight from the heart"" with panoramic techno that dives into the deepest depths of acid and electro. Drum machine hits crunch and snap into loud, rolling waves, foregrounding the subtle warmth of idyllic pads and intricate 303 sequences. Following the afterhours groove of the Reflections EP on Emotions Electric, this is a lovely retrospective of Lost Trax's earliest releases.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22152
Marcellus Pittman ‎- Revenge For Nothing / Red Dogon Star,Unirhythm,UNI1004,"House, Techno",January 2018,6,3.9,"There's an intriguing divide between Marcellus Pittman as a DJ and a producer. He meticulously mixes vinyl when he plays out and makes little-known cuts like Lood's ""Shout-N-Out"" and Terrence T's ""Power"" feel like classics. In the studio, he's a different beast—the soul is there, but it's overridden by gnarled machine funk. Late last year, Pittman revealed his first solo material in three years, a pair of 12-inches for his Unirhythm label. The first to hit stores, Revenge For Nothing / Red Dogon Star, contains two of his most out-there tracks to date.
 ""Revenge For Nothing"" is a brutalist minimal jack track centered around a relentless one-note bassline and a jackhammering snare. Sounding like something you'd find on a dusty DAT belonging to a Chicago OG, a rough comparison would be the unhinged acid tracks Adonis made with James ""Jack Rabbit"" Martin. The B-side, ""Red Dogon Star,"" is the highlight, a great example of the dream logic that sets Pittman's tracks apart. Some classic house elements—organ stabs, lush strings—are present but the pieces refuse to fall into place, making the final product banging yet misshapen. This feeling is compounded by an equally bizarre melodic hook. Pittman does a call and response with two basslines, as one thrums through delay and the other divebombs. The track ends unceremoniously, like the power went out in the midst of Pittman's oddball jam.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22117
K2 AKA Kero & Kyle Hall - Zug Tools,Detroit Underground,DU33,Techno,January 2018,Post a comment,3.8,"With its scorched-black land and smoggy sky, Detroit's infamous Zug Island looks like something out of dystopian fiction. Skirting Michigan's most polluted zip code and the decaying neighbourhood of Delray, Zug Island has housed steel refineries since the beginning of the 20th century, and is one of the last remaining coke producers—that's the fuel—in the US today. Strictly off-limits to the public and heavily guarded, it's a site of mystery and revile, complete with an elusive low-frequency rumble dubbed the ""Windsor Hum,"" which has plagued Ontario residents on the opposite riverbank for years.  In 2012, Kero and Kyle Hall produced a record about Zug Island. Written in studios on either side of Detroit's River Rouge, it translated the site's toxicity and strange allure to sound through guttural acid synth lines and clattering rhythms. Now there's Zug Tools, a gloopy acid tool package that is just as good. A low-end throb permeates ""FASTR000,"" which could be a nod to the ""Windsor Hum,"" with dark acid swells that bubble to the surface. ""19FT,"" on the B-side, drools with frothy venom. Both tracks continue one of the finest collaborations to emerge from Detroit in recent years.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22114
Missing Channel ‎- Remix,FJAAK,FJAAK002,Techno,February 2018,8,3.4,"By remixing a classic track from Robert Hood and Claude Young, the German trio FJAAK have chosen an audacious way to reboot their label. Then again, ""classic"" is a relative term here. The Missing Channel project is a fine relic of early '90s techno, but it's far from Hood or Young's best-known work. Remastered and remixed here, ""Onslaught"" came out in 1991 as the first release on Hood's Hardwax label. It's a rave-up that collapses breakbeat hardcore with high-octane elements—hoovers, crowd noises and a rowdy energy—of American techno. But even in this remastered version, ""Onslaught"" shows its age by sounding muddy—it might stick out like a fly on a wedding cake if played sets today.
 That's what FJAAK's remix is for. The group add a fat kick drum then layer and loop other parts so the slamming breakbeat becomes bouncy. They craft a modern warehouse techno track with a vintage heart, which makes their version of ""Onslaught"" more compatible with contemporary dance floors.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22118
Jayda G / Alexa Dash - Diva Bitch,Freakout Cult,CULT08,House,January 2018,1,3.6,"Jayda G and DJ Fett Burger's Freakout Cult is a base for joyful house music from producers who are relatively new to the label's listeners. The lilting breeze of last year's Monroe Bumpa / 186 Halin' left people intrigued about Laylay, Jayda G's collaborator on the EP. Listeners should be as equally curious about her latest musical partner, Alexa Dash, who collaborates on Diva Bitch. Dash's power vocals featured on 2016's Jaydaisms, but she didn't give the proper introduction we get here: ""Good evening, my name's Alexa Dash,"" she states with a deadpan voice on Diva Bitch's title track.
 The title version moves like someone strutting through a smoky bar. Dash's monologue on confidence and independence is paired with the jazzy flair of quiet bass notes and sultry piano. Written by her and Jayda, the lyrics are there to make dancers feel good as they step to the beat: ""I'm all kinds of beautiful / Yes I shine."" The ""Jayda G Get Down On Ur Knees Mix"" lit up Dekmantel during her Boiler Room set last year with its infectious hook, so it's great to see it get an official release. The ""Acappella Version"" invites DJs to create a new track of their own with Dash's husky voice.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22154
Mariel Ito - 2e Komst,Lone Romantic,LR002,Electro,January 2018,2,3.6,"Electro might be in the midst of a revival, but Eric Estornel is no fair-weather fan. The man otherwise known as Maceo Plex was making electro as Mariel Ito as far back as 2004, putting out records on labels like Modern Love and Connaisseur Recordings. His label Lone Romantic is even named after one of those earlier tracks. Estornel is looking back at Mariel Ito with an upcoming retrospective for R&S, but before that there's this EP of new material.
 ""Sintex49"" and ""Dmode90,"" right down to their jargon titles, are electro through-and-through, made by someone who knows their way around the genre. ""Sintex49"" has a sci-fi atmosphere, glitchy robot voices and gleefully broken drum patterns, and with its sighing synths and gurgling bassline ""Dmode90"" sounds like a track from a pupil of the Convextion and Gerald Donald school. But there's something a little different about Estornel's latest creations, with extra reverb on the drums making these tracks feel more suited to big rooms than most electro.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22105
DJ Koze - Seeing Aliens,Pampa,PAMPA030,"House, Tech House",January 2018,2,4.0,"DJ Koze might be the most adventurous big-room DJ out there, a trait also heard in his productions. There's no better recent example than ""Seeing Aliens (Extended Breakthrough Listen),"" the central track on his latest EP. With deranged squeals that sound like Stephan Bodzin's snake-charming Moog melodies heating in a microwave, it's a tune that could either clear the dance floor or elicit tears of joy. First there's the glitches, grating whirs and bleeps that would stop a party in its tracks as they overtake the room. They are paired with a kick drum that barely keeps pace as the mess of synths going haywire swamps the mix. But then a bright piano riff emerges through the bleepscape, sending sunshine beaming in as the glitches fade. It's a combination few artists would attempt, yet in Koze's hands it's magic.
 ""Nein König Nein"" is more conventional. A house track with the dusty feel of '90s hip-hop, it treads the warm terrain of Koze hits like ""Track ID Anyone?"" and ""Blume Der Nacht."" With strings, a shuffling beat and what sounds like a sitar, the seven-minute tune is a safer options for DJs, but it won't provoke the intense reactions the A-side will likely trigger. If the rest of Knock Knock, Koze's forthcoming album, is as strong as these two tracks, we may have another classic on our hands.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22206
Yoshinori Hayashi - Uncountable Set,Disco Halal,DH012,"Disco, Experimental",January 2018,1,3.8,"It's rare to come across a genuinely baffling record, but a dip into Yoshinori Hayashi's catalogue will skew the statistics. The Tokyo producer doesn't trade in unfamiliar sounds, exactly—it's more that he scrambles the logic of the familiar, twisting orderly forms into head-spinning nightmares. The average Hayashi track might be anarchic sample-collage, ramshackle synthesis or a multi-tracked ensemble of live musicians—it's hard to tell. Maybe you're actually hearing several pieces of music, squeezed into a cramped space and left to get on with it.  Hayashi's ideas often sound like dodgy reconstructions of a half-forgotten dance music canon. The feeling is particularly pronounced on his latest EP, for Disco Halal, which follows dazzling meltdowns on Going Good and Lovers Rock, and mimics the feeling of plunging through a kitschy Discogs wormhole. ""Palanquin Bearing Monkey"" could be bubbly proto-house meets heat-warped jazz fusion, the two layers rutting over a chuntering piano bassline ferried in from South America. Every now and then, a chipmunk voice—Hayashi himself?—sings a few mournful lines.
 On ""Stepping On Dewdrops"" taut post-punk disco meets the clammy organs of a B-movie horror soundtrack. The track's forest of percussion gets thicker until a cellist appears in the undergrowth, mad-eyed, mumbling and scratching out a house-of-horrors melody. ""Pneuma"" extends to an epic, disorientating nine minutes. It's both the funkiest track here—check the walk-the-dog jazz bassline—and the most forbidding, its disco beat weaving sharklike through a reverberant ocean of discordant orchestral sounds. From there we ditch out into the sparser ""Chember,"" where keening wordless vocals are layered in ever-denser loops. It's the EP's only half-predictable moment, and thus its weakest.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22120
Various - ÆX005,ÆX,AX005,Techno,January 2018,Post a comment,3.6,"Last year Maarten Mittendorff and Jasper Wolff launched ÆX, a compilation subsidiary to their main label, Indigo Aera. ÆX has so far mostly released music by friends from Amsterdam, the city where Mittendorff and Wolff are based. Several artists have made repeat outings on the label, and this is Kaap and 543FF's third ÆX appearance. Both label owners with a bit more production mileage behind them, Rotterdam's Ben Buitendijk and the Mistress affiliate Daniel Jacques are the new signees.
 With one exception—""Novum""—dreamy, dubbed-out techno is the prevailing sound on ÆX005. Buitendijk's slide here into tougher terrain is a welcomed one, and the spangled note that corkscrews through the middle adds a trippy undertone to this driving floor-filler. ""Behind The Dark, There Shall Be Light"" from Jacques uses drowsy, detuned synths to create a thick haze, which breaks down in a maelstrom of frantic arpeggios and thunder—a neat reset. 543FF ends on a cooler dub techno tip with scintillating hats and frosty details that leave you tingling.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22113
Robert Hood - Paradygm Shift Volume 3,Dekmantel,DKMNTL055,Techno,February 2018,32,3.0,"Robert Hood's Paradygm Shift promised both a return to the Detroit pioneer's minimal roots and a future-facing search for electronic music's ""new mindset."" So far the project hasn't quite been either. Its slick techno productions lack the DIY dynamism of Hood's classic tracks, but don't offer anything fresh. Instead they slot neatly into a big-room techno space that has already been recycling Hood's sound for two decades. Dance music owes an enormous debt to the man—there's not much in Paradygm Shift that will change the balance sheet one way or the other.
 These two tracks, which conclude the Paradygm Shift EP trilogy started in 2016 (there was an album in between), are more of the same. They're not bad—from a technical standpoint they're effortlessly proficient—but they won't satisfy diehard Hood fans looking to rekindle an old flame, nor current club kids seeking a rush of the new. Above all the choice of sounds might grate on ears attuned to modern clichés. ""Red Machine""'s white noise swirls, synth pedal drone and minor-key pads, building to a series of Epic™ climaxes, push well-worn buttons. The subtler ""Transform"" shifts down a couple of gears, building tension over a shoulder-swaying five-odd minutes of chord spume and precision groove.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22133
Detboi - Ice Cold,Metalheadz,METHPLA26,Drum & Bass,February 2018,1,3.8,"Tinkling piano is not something I expected to hear on the follow-up to last year's most punishing drum & bass record, but here we are. ""Blood Drops"" opens Ice Cold with a hybrid of liquid funk and Des McGouran's steely, no-nonsense pummelling. With snatches of melody—laced with dub effects, of course—lush reverb and an epic scale, it lives up to anything on Secrets.
 They are are big shoes to fill, and to his credit, McGouran almost outdoes himself on the two other slabs of mayhem. ""Darkness,"" with nimble drum programming and a trippy bassline that ghosts across the stereo spectrum, is the standout, while ""Ice Cold Blood On The Drums"" is pure techstep worship. But where McGouran's best tracks feel unpredictable, its over-the-top speech samples make it feel slightly dated. Like Secrets, Ice Cold comes with two digital bonus tracks, this time at Detboi's old stomping ground of around 130 BPM. You should check them out for ""Beast"" and its jack-hammering breakbeat, which sounds like a CD skipping during a brutal drum & bass track.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22108
Russell Haswell - Respondent,Diagonal Records,DIAG043,"Techno, Experimental",February 2018,10,3.8,"Russell Haswell only yielded to the tyranny of the drumbeat a few years back. 2014's 37 Minute Workout and 2015's As Sure As Night Follows Day, both for Diagonal, were sprawling and exploratory, as if he was mapping out the techno space one white noise shriek at a time. By comparison, his latest EP for the label is short and sharp, and arranged almost like a conventional dance record. There are a couple of straighter club tracks, some tricksy interludes and an extended vocal number to round things off.  Only, this being Haswell, the club bangers are strange. The convulsive ""First In Man (Williams Mix)"" and the slamming ""Let Suffering Become You"" are awkwardly minimal accretions of blunt drums and raw-concrete synths. The latter track opens with a sample of Jonathan Guinness, 3rd Baron Moyne, complaining that punk fans ""would really like to be back in those days when they could actually see physical people hacking each other to death.""  The not-quite-dance interludes aren't moments of downtime but a cold slap to the face. The latter of the two, the rhythmic noise rager ""Worsening Daily,"" is the EP's screwface moment. The vocal track is completely bizarre, a ten-minute string of spiky rhythms over which Sue Tompkins, once of the indie band Life Without Buildings, improvises yelps and whoops and sing-song non sequiturs. (""But I never thought… Luxury? Let it pick you up!"") It's a deeply unsettling duet, which I guess is exactly how Haswell intended it.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22125
The Panacea - Above The Absolute,Sonic Groove,SGD1882,Techno,January 2018,Post a comment,3.6,"Mathis Mootz brought a new level of intensity to late '90s drum & bass with tracks that helped lay the blueprint for breakcore. His musical vision encompassed everything hard and heavy, and his most recent work as The Panacea combines EDM, hardcore techno, gabber and breakcore as a noxious brew. Adam X, who never shies away from rowdy dance music, has tapped Mootz for his first-ever techno EP. The results are predictably weighty and surprisingly dynamic.
 Each side of Above The Absolute takes a different approach. The A-side highlights Mootz's hardcore and drum & bass influences, particularly with the brutal title track, which grinds, saws and writhes its way around the booming kick drum. Listen carefully, and you can hear breaks buried inside. Those latent influences surface on ""Most Basic Resolution,"" which is programmed like modern techno but built with the craggy materials of modern hardcore and drum & bass. The B-side is more in line with peak-time at European techno clubs. ""Overdrive EE"" has all the nasty elements of its predecessors but keeps the noise at bay, while ""Walter"" is almost funky.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22112
Charlotte De Witte - Brussels EP,novamute,12NOMU181,Techno,December 2017,2,3.4,"A few years ago Charlotte De Witte shed her Raving George moniker to release and perform under her own name, and she's been gaining traction ever since. She admits that she considers herself more of a DJ than a producer, having spent the last eight years doing the former. A functional, dance floor-first mentality colours her tracks, which have been picked up by Turbo, Sleaze and Mary Go Wild. ""Less is more"" is De Witte's mantra, and her stripped-back approach, when embellished with the right details, has proven fruitful. The Belgian artist's first record of 2018 lands on the newly revived NovaMute following EPs from Nicolas Bougaïeff and Terence Fixmer.  ""Brussels"" and ""Look Around You"" have strong vocal lines. The listless repetition of ""gone"" in ""Brussels"" complements De Witte's ominous pads. In this case, the vocals amplify the mood of the track, a big-room hit. They distract and fatigue on ""Look Around You,"" where the message is schmaltzy and the repetition becomes wearisome. The tough and driving ""Control"" is the best of the three, with a heavily treated vocal grumbling incomprehensibly though the centre. It's a more adventurous hook, but vocals are starting to feel like a crutch in De Witte's tracks. It would be great to hear what she can do without them.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22115
Fantastic Man pres. P.M.T.C. ‎- P.M.T.C.,Superconscious Records,SCR010,"Techno, Trance",December 2017,3,3.5,"Fantastic Man, AKA Mic Newman, has dared to reinvent himself a few times in his relatively short career. For his latest project, Newman adopts a new moniker, P.M.T.C., and shifts away from the disco-influenced house productions that launched his career, and the tribal and acid excursions that followed
 For this self-titled record on Superconscious Records, the label he co-runs with Francis Inferno Orchestra, Newman nods to early trance and Detroit techno. ""Reality Change"" feels inspired by the Mike Banks project The Martian. A dubbed-out intro leads into a driving rhythm, as chords continually rise without quite reaching a climax, which is perhaps the point. It's both hypnotic and dreamy. The same goes for the EP's second track, ""Cool Waters,"" where the bassline rolls and subtle whistles and synths push things along. It reaches a peak—of sorts—with an R&B-esque vocal sample, then another cut-up vocal that carries the tune to a conclusion that clatters into the void. As P.M.T.C. Newman is eager to explore new sounds, and while this EP is not quite thrilling, it's a promising start.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22107
Yung Acid - Thug Mansions,New York Haunted,NYH132,"Techno, Grime",January 2018,3,3.9,"Yung Acid are a young Russian duo on the rise. Besides running their own label, Get Busy!, and organising parties between their hometowns of Kazan and Moscow, they've featured on a number of cassette compilations, including U S S R (Ur Social Status Resistance), a compilation of Russian and Ukrainian experimental dance music curated by Opal Tapes. Their sound is a cantankerous yet infectious mix of techno, acid and grime that Drvg Cvltvre debuted on his New York Haunted label in 2016. Now they’re back with an album’s worth of mutant bangers.
 Some tracks—""RA​-​8PM,"" ""Isrl""—sound like Hessle Audio meets Broken English Club on a dark and stormy night, while others tinker with electro, dubstep and breaks. In each case there's an unexpected mashup going on, and the results are both freakish and tremendous. Take ""So Fresh,"" which manages to turn a cacophony of dogs and car alarms—or so it seems—into a dark, gyrating number that would set the right floor alight. Thug Mansions is a rip-roaring first opus from a club act destined for big things.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22110
James Blake - If The Car Beside You Moves Ahead,Polydor,N/A,"Pop, Experimental",January 2018,23,4.4,"Whether he's singing an otherworldly torch song or sending his voice through filters, James Blake has a way of stopping people in their tracks. He's gained a fan base that ranges from underground dance heads to rock kids to Beyoncé. On his latest song, ""If The Car Beside You Moves Ahead,"" Blake's voice is back at the forefront. It stutters and loops like an old chopped-and-screwed mixtape, a return to the psychedelic manipulation of Blake's early dance floor records. The production, which cleaves most words in half, is both riveting and vaguely frustrating—the distorted syllables force you to listen closely to decipher the lyrics, lending the track urgency. There's also something menacing about it, especially the helium-voiced chorus where Blake sings, ""If the car beside you moves ahead / As much as it might feel as though you're dead / You're not going backwards.""
 Blake backs himself up with a plangent instrumental that sounds like a melting jazz ensemble. A gooey bassline pools underneath the chorus before making way for a spoken-word verse. Even then it's not easy to understand the lyrics, but like much of Blake's music the meaning is in the feeling—not only the words. ""If The Car Beside You Moves Ahead"" plays to his strengths, combining his soulful voice, cosmic production and haunting hooks until you can't hear where one ends and the other begins.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22116
TSVI - Rambo,Nervous Horizon,NH007,"Techno, UK Funky",January 2018,Post a comment,3.9,"TSVI stripped his last release for Nervous Horizon down to the drums. The London-based producer retooled UK funky with percussion from around the globe, hitting a dazzlingly effective formula. His latest EP is a natural continuation. Fusing fractured drums that reference gqom or kuduro and melodies that nod to grime, its best tracks are precise, unfussy and lethal. ""Pull Up"" and ""Roller"" perform a similar trick, ramping up the tension with dramatic breakdowns before dropping into a drum track. It's unusual but dynamic, making the drums' agility—not the weight of the kick—the main attraction. ""Funky T"" pairs tricky rhythms with a bass tone so deep it sounds like the speakers have blown. Though each cut is aimed at peak-time, they slink and sway as much as they bang.
 Of the collaborations, ""Xus Lord"" with DJ JM, the Lithuanian producer fresh from an impressive debut EP, is closest to TSVI's solo sound. Luru turns ""Pull Up"" into a grime blockbuster, all lurching bass and gleaming melodies, while Wallwork, who helped TSVI cook up 2016's incendiary ""Facts,"" steals the show. Over loping metallic drums, ""Jaguar"" ducks and weaves towards an unhinged finale that's equal parts noise and trance.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22093
Azimute ‎- The Secret,Cocoon Recordings,COR12148,"Minimal, House, Techno",January 2018,1,3.5,"For the first time in a while, Cocoon has enjoyed some prerelease hype. This is thanks to Cristi Cons' 11-minute remix that sits on the B-side of its latest release, Azimute's The Secret. As one half of SIT, Cons has produced his share of slinky club weapons, most involving catchy basslines and tumbling grooves. He brings his jazzy touch to a label more accustomed to big-room sounds. The remix racked up more than 30,000 plays on YouTube before its release, which can likely be put down to a few things: a killer bassline, multiple appearances at the last Sunwaves festival and plenty of club play by top-flight Romanian DJs. It's a fairly standard SIT-style roller but with the rare addition of vocals—in other words, the kind of minimal that gets people talking if played by the right DJs.
 The EP's other tracks aim for different moods. The original version of ""The Secret"" is the least original option, with white noise, reverb and what sounds like a triangle. Its piano-house-meets-tech-house sound gets grating as it builds towards the climax, which fails to find a sweet spot between seemingly incompatible elements. Quenum & Cesare Vs Disorder's remix is deeper, with a focus on bass. It builds from a stuttering pulse to a slick percussive banger, hitting the groove that the original couldn't. The Secret was a hit before it reached stores, so let's see if the impact matches the hype.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22147
Jorge Gamarra - Introversión,Trichome,TCM001,"Techno, Electro",December 2017,3,4.0,"Jorge Gamarra is among the Uruguayan artists bridging the gap between their home country and Europe. Operating out of Barcelona, he runs the standout Sur label with the Berlin-based Argentinian Gulp. There's no solid information about Trichome, the label behind Introversión, but one can gather Gamarra has something to do with it. It's his most substantial dispatch since SUR001, a late 2016 sleeper hit
 Introversión is substantially odder, and Gamarra's will to be weird feels natural. He takes risks, especially on ""Ansias."" In the opening passages, he sets up a bittersweet pad bed and builds effortless movement with a weaving bassline. Then the first breakdown swerves toward sensory overload as a matrix of jabbering machines overtake the mix. It's intense enough to turn some away but as the bassline reintroduces the intro's minor key, it all comes together. The title track isn't quite as dazzling, but the bass movements are similarly effortless, supplying interesting rhythmic punctuation and a moody harmony embellished by wispy lead lines.  The B-side is just as strong. ""INTP"" takes a chunkier, electro-leaning route, pairing dry, overheated drums with deep space twinkles and a background pad. ""Vrmdrm,"" perhaps a reference to the Vermona DRM1 drum machine, is the EP's most paranoid tune. Where the other tracks have rays of light, ""Vrmdrm"" goes full space cadet, with wonky bass and splashy drums creating a stomping but inviting groove. Although some of the tracks would have worked without a pad or two, Introversión is perfect tackle for weirding up the dance.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22106
Locked Groove - Whistle,Locked Groove Records,LGR004,Techno,January 2018,Post a comment,3.5,"Since his first record, Tim Van De Meutter has been melding genres into a sleek and sparkling modern alloy. He mixes the pomp of prog house with the steely resolve of contemporary techno, leading to gems like ""Rooted"" and appearances on labels like Life And Death and Kompakt. He hasn't had a solo release in three years, so Whistle is a fine comeback.
 ""Whistle"" is up there with Van De Meutter's best tracks. It sounds like an update of an old BT tune, pumping and proggy with a wiry bassline. Throw in the spasms of dubbed-out chords and taut rhythms and you've got something that brings a touch of the '90s trance label Perfecto to a 2018 dance floor. ""Birds Of Prey"" isn't as fetching, but it's a solid tool, putting a bright spin on warehouse techno without getting too flashy. These tracks could signal a more mature and well-oiled Locked Groove sound, which would make his return all the more welcome.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22104
Stephan Bodzin ‎- Strand,Afterlife,AL009,"Techno, Minimal",December 2017,8,3.6,"Stephan Bodzin has been showing us the power of melody on the dance floor for over ten years. His snake-charming productions laid the groundwork for a cinematic sound adopted by many high-profile producers, including those on Afterlife, Tale Of Us's label, which hosts his latest release. Discogs labels Strand ""neo trance,"" which feels like an accurate description for the title track, a sprawling eight-minute epic built around Bodzin's trademark delicate arpeggios. It's not particularly energetic, but it's easy to imagine a peak-time dance floor swaying to its trancey melodies and the occasional blast of atonal sludge—another Bodzin trademark.
 ""Catamaran"" loses the arpeggio and is therefore less trancey. There's more empty space in the mix, which puts the attention on the main synth riff, recurring stabs that become grander as the track progresses. The same goes for the atmospherics, which thicken as the energy builds. Bodzin is a masterful producer, and tricks like these have helped him become one of the best-loved live performers in electronic music.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22141
Oscar Mulero - Acceptance,Semantica Records,SEM0703,"Experimental, Ambient",January 2018,2,3.5,"The relationship between techno and not-techno in Oscar Mulero's music goes back to his days in the mid-'90s Madrid scene. As he told RA's James Manning, he'd open nights at The Omen with the ambient music of the time—Aphex Twin, Autechre—before playing Jeff Mills and Dave Clarke at peak-time. His debut album, 2011's Green Fades To Grey, was structured to reflect this dichotomy: the ""grey"" part was techno, the ""green"" ambient. Mulero's music may have moved on since then, but this '90s idea of chill-out directs his latest pivot off the dance floor.
 Sometimes you hear it in specific sounds, like the glitched-out broken beat groove of ""Depth In Clarity,"" which calls to mind Autechre's early b-boy moves, and the balmy comedown synths in the second half of ""Acceptance."" Elsewhere it's more of an attitude: the use of brain-tickling downtempo syncopation with spacey sound design seems tailor-made for the reclining cyborg on the front of the Artificial Intelligence compilation. Still, this being the '10s, the cyborg wears black these days and has a tranche of gnarly tattoos.
 ""Exhale And Expand"" aside, Mulero's experimental cuts come with a heavy funereal mood, with the titles that seal the deal. On several tracks, atonal synth parts echo through ominous crypt-like spaces. ""Crux"" frames them with an unsettled groove that, if pitched down a bit, could be Horo-style halftime drum & bass. ""Edges Of Mortality"" is firmer, and has a techno-like breakdown, in which the beat subsides to nothing before flickering back into sinister life.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22102
Rian Treanor - Contraposition,Arcola,ARC07,"IDM, Experimental, Club",January 2018,3,4.0,"Rian Treanor's third release revives Warp's Arcola sub-label, which was last spotted in 2004. Treanor, like Warp, is from Sheffield, and is part of a new IDM bloom, alongside the likes of Lanark Artefax and Lee Gamble's UIQ roster. Perhaps more than his peers or forefathers—Autechre, Aphex Twin and his actual father, Mark Fell—he's committed to IDM's dance floor potential.  On Contraposition, loops evolve into multi-stage breakdowns. There's a strong sense of rave energy in their build-ups, especially in ""Contra_A2."" Contraposition plays with frequencies, as heard in the birdcall squeals and metallic bass of ""Position_B2."" The term ""contraposition"" comes from formal mathematical logic, which is a foundation of programming code. Like footwork, Treanor's music plays with so many beat variations that it gives dancers plenty of space for interpretation. And while you might expect the precision to be unapologetically robotic, it's somehow impossibly funky.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22101
Gunnar Haslam - KL01,Kavalanic Languages,KL01,"Techno, Ambient",January 2018,1,3.9,"Gunnar Haslam is a prolific artist. Collaborations aside, he's released four albums and seven solo EPs since 2013. High output alone isn't interesting—it's often the opposite—but it's been engaging to watch Haslam herd his swarms of tracks into coherent groups. Last year's Kalaatsakia LP for The Bunker was his most compelling attempt yet, liaising skilfully between mind-bending techno and various forms of ambient. The New Yorker's latest project seems to take a different approach to crowd control. Kavalanic Languages is a label with a time limit: after one year, and five Haslam releases under various aliases, it will shut down. The first focusses on a single side of his sound, and more or less nails it.  Noxious techno loopers, veined with dissonant synth parts and fogged with delay, are the order of the day. Each track manoeuvres quickly into a Goldilocks zone and stays there, letting the subtle play of polyrhythmic sequences modulate the flow. ""Sostanze"" and ""Atayalic"" are more intense, while ""Ururu"" is slyer at first, before peaking with gaseous hi-hats and a late-entry clap. All three are extremely solid dance floor mind-melters. In fine techno tradition, an ambient track completes the set. ""Ialysas"" sounds like Autechre, or like one of those spiders from Lost In Space stalking across a microtonal keyboard. Like the others, it's expertly realised.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22099
ајс дог - бабилон фиш,Brutaz,BRUTAZ05,"Techno, Experimental",January 2018,Post a comment,3.5,"Brutaż, a party and label based in Warsaw, is a key node of adventurous club music in Central Europe. Its parties push local talent while bringing in bold DJs from abroad (Discwoman, Erika and Courtesy being recent guests). Its records showcase new and little-known artists who embody the outfit's scrappy, experimental flair. The latest 12-inch, Ice Dog's Babylon Fish, is particularly oblique. The artist name and title use Cyrillic letters to spell English words. The track names, when they're more than cryptic acronyms, are in Serbian. As for the music, it's classic Brutaż: a filthy blend of leftfield techno and experimental electronics.  The five tracks on Babylon Fish are sinister in mood but pleasingly rich in atmosphere. For my money, their bleak palettes work best when applied to more accessible structures, like on ""Biti Ovde,"" a darkly funky slo-mo groover, and ""2vs,"" a techno cut whose industrial haze recalls peak-era Skinny Puppy. The other tracks have harsher sounds and more dilapidated rhythms. ""29gt"" stumbles mechanically through peals of noise. ""Kolutovi"" teems queasily like a mound of insects. ""U Glavi Leti Ptica Belim Repom Meduze"" would nicely soundtrack a human sacrifice ritual. The nightmarish vibe can get a bit much at times, but the production, as vicious as it is surreal, is never anything short of inspired.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22098
Valerie Dore ‎- Get Closer,Running Back,RBSSS2,Italo,December 2017,2,3.5,"Tinkering with classics is a path fraught with danger, but that doesn't stop the German label Running Back from trying its hand with Super Sound Singles, a series of releases focused on updating ""inexpensive"" disco and pop hits, perhaps spurning the worship of rare, expensive records. The second in the series is a revision of the 1984 hit ""Get Closer"" by Valerie Dore, a slow, romantic slice of italo disco. Label boss Gerd Janson thankfully retains much of that quality in the edit, extending its length and making some subtle changes to the track's arrangement. This less-is-more approach makes the edit compelling.
 As for the remixes, Tiger & Woods stick close to the original in their usual style. Much of the track loops parts of the verse, burning away until the climax five minutes in. The DJ Oyster ""Tool"" filters and echoes the vocals as though you're hearing the lyrics in the back of your mind, but it's ultimately for DJ-use only.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22092
Daniel Avery - Slow Fade EP,Phantasy Sound,PH60,"Techno, Downtempo, Ambient",January 2018,16,3.6,"It's funny what a few dozen spins round the DJ circuit can do to you. When he first turned heads, shortly before 2013's Drone Logic, Daniel Avery was a disciple of Erol Alkan and Andrew Weatherall, offering a '10s spin on sultry indie-dance. In the years since he seems to have developed a very different conception of club music. Talking on The Hour about his 2016 DJ-Kicks mix, he described a fascination with ""the idea of music working in a hypnotic way,"" citing a group of labels and artists with whom he felt he was ""part of something"": Semantica, Northern Electronics, Iori, Rrose. Avery's forthcoming second album, Song For Alpha, is his first major statement as a producer in years, and will likely crystallise his latterday vision—at least if this taster 12-inch is anything to go by.  Slow Fade doesn't entrance in quite the way you'd expect. You'll need to wait until the record's back-end for a slice of the hypno-techno sound that now defines Avery's sets. The swirling, delirious ""Fever Dream"" is a solid attempt, its menacing mood turning suddenly euphoric in the final minute. Avery also explores hypnosis by different means. ""Slow Fade"" and ""Radius"" are high-definition updates of classic comedown downtempo, pairing booming drums with ambrosial pads that tug at frayed heartstrings. ""Slow Fade"" starts paranoid before chords lift us up at the midpoint, while ""Radius"" is more ambiguous, stretching to a moody eight minutes. The ambient track, ""After Dark,"" glowers and crackles without ever quite coming into focus. Avery's new album will be good if it follows Slow Fade's teasing lead.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22103
Wilted Woman - Watching The Psycho,Primitive Languages,PL021,"Experimental, Techno",January 2018,Post a comment,3.7,"Wilted Woman isn't concerned with making her music DJ-friendly, but her beautifully strange techno creations have become more dance floor-oriented over time. This was heard best on her first 12-inch, for James K's She Rocks! label, last year, which was full of chaotic lasers and mechanic melodies. Like fellow Berlin artist Silvia Kastel, her music has mostly been released through cassette, but she's recently moved to vinyl. Her latest EP, Watching The Psycho, draws you even further into the dance floor. Its unconventional format—a 7-inch—feels like a typical Wilted Move: the music is dance floor-friendly, but it will be tough to play in a club.
 With a tight 4/4 kick, ""Böse Mango"" is more straightforward than Wilted Woman's usual rhythms. But the track still has the enchantingly weird hallmarks we expect from her, as an oscillating 8-bit-style synth floats with the grace of a flute over a sassy bassline. Near the end of the track, the 4/4 evaporates and we're left with synths twirling in the air alone. The sludgy ""Sorry"" and ""Onwon"" complement each other with clacking percussion, creeping synth sequences and saturated melodies. Watching The Psycho captures the duality of functional music and the frantic synth experimentations that make Wilted Woman's live sets exhilarating.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22096
Jasen Loveland - My Medicine,Acid Camp,ACR004,Acid,January 2018,1,3.7,"""When you roll in, you can expect to be immersed into a world with one purpose: to make you lose your fucking mind."" This is how the Los Angeles producer Jasen Loveland described the No Way Back parties, which he credits with helping shape his sound. In return, the Detroit crew featured Loveland in their anniversary Acid Series—last year's Vol 1 was his debut release. This follow-up, for the label arm of LA's Acid Camp party, is no less faithful to rebooted acid techno. If anything it's even tougher, subscribing to the No Way Back ethos that acid isn't about the means (though there's plenty of 303 here) so much as the ends: hallucinatory liftoff.
 Loveland is said to be a ""doctor of medicine"" by day, and the label quips that his prescriptions ""may not be suitable for all patients inquiring."" You can see why on ""My Medicine,"" a surgically redlined drum track with a yammering synth lead. It's both a steady groover and terrifyingly intense, combining pummelling rhythm and mid-range swirl to send the body and mind spinning in different directions. ""Epoxy (Space Mix)"" is a deeper trip, its one-note 303 line a trance-inducing didgeridoo chuntering in the foreground while spooky chords drift by. ""Paranoid Fantasy (Unlimited Mix)"" splits the difference between the two—it has both paranoid intrigue and jet-engine propulsion—while a remix of ""Epoxy"" from No Way Back's Patrick Russell offers a bit of a breather. Which isn't to say that it goes easier on the acid—it's just Loveland's trippy medicine is administered in slightly more humane doses.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22057
Henry Wu & Earl Jeffers - Projections / Hi-Life,MCDE,MCDE1216,"Broken Beat, House",January 2018,9,4.0,"Broken beat first emerged in West London during the late '90s. The style was hard to pin down, but stuttering post-rave beats, rare groove-inspired melodies and hip-hop sampling aesthetics were common. Early in his career, Motor City Drum Ensemble was a champion of the genre. As part of Inverse Cinematics he was among a number of German acts that ran with the sound during the early '00s. This latest release on his label comes from Henry Wu and Earl Jeffers, two young acts who are reestablishing broken beat's eclectic spirit.
 Both tracks here are excellent. The drums have a funky syncopation close to a classic Masters At Work beat. The keys, played by Henry Wu, are harmonically complicated without being fussy. Wu's musical chops are showcased in his work in the groups Yussef Kamaal and, more recently, Kamaal Williams, but that musicality is focussed at the dance floor here. The results are something between jazz fusion and classic house—a balancing act that's easy to get wrong. ""Projections"" offers a Roy Ayers-esque vibraphone and a neat section from Larry Young's ""Turn Off The Lights,"" a sample likely inspired by Jay Dilla's production wizardry on Slum Village's ""Fat Cat Song."" ""Hi Life"" is a piano house banger. It's a sound that could easily sound clichéd, but Wu's keyboard talent ensures there's never a dull moment.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22097
Deepchord & Fluxion present Transformations - Accumulate EP,Vibrant Music,VMR001,Dub Techno,January 2018,4,3.3,"There are few partnerships in dub techno as enticing as DeepChord and Fluxion. One is the unquestionable American ambassador for the style, the other a Greek artist who released his first records on Chain Reaction. Rod Modell and Konstantinos Soublis's new project, Transformations, goes back to a series of improvised jam sessions in 2014. They debuted their collaboration last December in San Francisco with a set of ""dyed-in-the-wool"" dub techno, and the first release carries that spirit of improvisation, finding the two heads deep in a meditative zone.
 Accumulate starts mid-stride with a housey skip. Percussive noises ping-pong between the stereo spectrum as if caught in a slipstream, while the synths are layered meticulously, each strand made of shimmering gossamer. It hums along nicely, building momentum until it fades out and you flip the vinyl over. Instead of continuing where it left off, ""Accumulate (Part 2)"" sounds like it starts from a random part in the same session, then cruises along for another 11 minutes. There are moments of beauty on Accumulate, with a production quality that lives up to this calibre of collaboration. Live, Transformations is meant to create an ""improvisational sound environment"" through long-form composition. But the project is missing something in EP form.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22059
STL - If Time Would Move Backwards,Solar Phenomena,SOLAR04,House,January 2018,3,4.0,"If the lo-fi house of acts like Mall Grab and DJ Seinfeld is an entry point for the next generation of dance music fans, you hope they'll eventually stumble upon the work of STL, AKA Stephan Laubner, the German producer who was a grandmaster of the sound way before it had a name. His latest EP, If Time Would Move Backwards, is another cracker, presenting four bewitching club cuts in the classic Laubner mould, full of crunchy drums, grubby melodies and basslines as thick as tar.  Laubner's last EP, Nonzero Sonics, was dubby and slow-moving, but he's perkier here. The melody on ""Spy Vs Spy,"" the record's strangest track, is bright and uncontrollably jerky, as if someone were fiddling with the FM dial. The off-kilter drums don't help, giving the whole thing a nauseous strut, like a drunk navigating the stairs. ""Atomsmasha,"" by contrast, is metronomic in its march, with a hefty bassline churning away under a four-note synth line and the faint rattle of maracas. It's simple but totally engrossing, the kind of killer locked groove Laubner knocks out for fun.  Things get even better on the B-side. Both tracks skew traditional deep house, though ""Summer Breeze & Brotherhood"" is more upbeat, the touch of distortion on the gorgeous melody invoking the haze of a hot day. It's a track, as the title suggests, for dancing in the sun with your nearest and dearest. ""Freebird,"" the longest cut by a couple minutes, is mellower and busier, with strings, soft piano, faint female coos and a moving synth motif slowly swirling atop fuzzy kicks. Somehow, it all comes together beautifully.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22094
Black Merlin - Archives,Berceuse Heroique,BH0425,"Techno, EBM, Synth Pop",January 2018,3,4.1,"In 2014, Black Merlin released the Amazing Exotics EP on the label Crimes Of The Future, who described it as a cross between avant-garde '80s pop and Berlin techno—""Trevor Horn heads to Berghain at 3 AM Friday and stays till Monday."" These two worlds collide in a not dissimilar way on Archives, whose five tracks span synth pop, EBM and techno, all made to an impressive standard.  Agro"" and ""Shock"" are the techno tracks. The former's drones and shakers crackle as though flowing with volatile electrical current. ""Shock""'s meat-hammer pump and corrosive harmonics are equally grim. On ""The Alpaca Pet Boys,"" we get a second dose of ""Relax""-meets-Snax. Its rich bass and vocal sighs—sounds you might recognise from classic tracks by Frankie Goes To Hollywood and Yello—drive a synth pop tribute with a ton of dance floor appeal. This '80s-charged mood also dazzles on the EBM-ish ""12515,"" whose vox synths and phasing effects ripple like heat haze. ""Laz"" brings some eventual relief. Once its humming chords and lead fade, an oceanic shimmer lingers. It's the first time across 49 minutes that Archives lets up.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22056
Negative Gemini - Bad Baby,100% Electronica,N/A,"Pop, Breaks, House",January 2018,2,4.0,"Lindsey French started her latest record in New York and finished it in Richmond, Virginia, under tragic circumstances. She returned to her hometown because her sister was murdered, and there's a mood shift from laidback to vulnerable about halfway through the EP. In both modes Bad Baby is an arresting blend of contemporary dance music and wistful indie pop that takes the featherweight trance of French's older work and moulds it into melancholic songcraft.  Vocals are central to French's music. On ""Bad Baby"" and ""Infin Path"" she uses wordless sighs to give her chord progressions a certain lilt, while ""Infin Path,"" the EP's best song, is a breakbeat head rush that recalls Opus III's ""It's A Fine Day."" The jaunty house of ""Bad Baby"" is no slouch either, and it comes with an aching chorus that gets stuck in your head. The ""Club Mix"" is an alternate take that transforms it into a Radio 1-style banger with a hummable bassline and deft vocal chopping.
 It's with ""You Weren't There Anymore,"" which juxtaposes a pillowy Balearic feel with an emo-inspired vocal, that the EP takes a wistful turn. ""Skydiver"" is almost somber with its soft-focus synth organs, while the stark and elegant ""My Innocence"" ends the EP with gilded arpeggios and raw screaming that strains French's vocal cords. The influence of rock music—French namechecked artists like Weezer and Blink-182 in a recent interview—makes her music feel particularly fresh. She approaches dance music from an angle that feels more honest than trendy, putting the emphasis on emotion over rhythm. An EP that carries more weight than its breezy feel might first imply, Bad Baby is weightier than it might first appear, and an example of how dance music can help people through tough times.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22090
Scott Grooves - 2nd 7 Inch,"<li>
<div>
Label /",N/A,"Funk, Soul",November 2017,3,3.7,"Records don't come more Detroit than Scott Grooves' latest. 2nd 7 Inch comes with a charred wood adapter—with a pleasantly smoky workshop smell—whose design portrays the city riverfront. The A-side, ""Oceans Of Thoughts And Dreams,"" is an instrumental cover of a song by the Detroit soul group The Dramatics. Besides Grooves, the players involved—Ian Fink, Glenn Tucker, Alex White—are young local musicians. A far more established Detroit band, One Way, assists Grooves on ""So Glad."" As the producer recently explained in an email, ""I wanted to bring together on one record youth and veterans, thus showing that good music can help bridge the generation gap.""
 And 2nd 7 Inch is good music. ""So Glad"" is an upbeat funk track with vocals from Al Hudson, who sings the praises of a loved one. Given the context, some might read the lyrics as a tribute to Detroit, but it's doubtful that anyone calls the Motor City—or any city, for that matter—a ""cutie pie."" (Incidentally, that's also the name of one of Hudson's band's biggest hits.) ""Oceans Of Thoughts And Dreams"" reworks the original in a more assertive spirit. The Rhodes keys are slightly overworked, but the organ anchors the song nicely while the drumming keeps things tight. Grooves, as is his habit, plays the background: someone who doesn't toot his own horn taps the conga instead. In a sense, 2nd 7 Inch isn't really about him—it's an affectionate showcase of the musical heritage that has served him so well.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22061
Stanislav Tolkachev - Blue Mood / Absolute Limit,Intergalactic Research Institute for Sound,IRIS002,Techno,January 2018,3,3.8,"The increasingly prolific Ukrainian techno maverick Stanislav Tolkachev starts the new year with another welcome blast from the past. After a repress of the 2011 two-tracker Why Are You So Frightened on Rivet's reactivated Pohjola label last fall, the classic ""Blue Mood"" gets new life on a 10-inch slab of clear wax issued by Irakli's new Intergalactic Research Institute For Sound. Tolkachev recorded ""Blue Mood"" in 2003 and saw it released five years later on the short-lived—and underrated—Aftertaste Recordings. Like much of his work it has a certain timeless quality, thanks to a minimalist approach that remains stark even by Tolkachev's standards. This is captivating electronic music, a propulsive soundscape where a syncopated, atonal machine riff is coupled with acidic modulations and spatial effects.
 ""Absolute Limit"" is a new and more straightforward 4/4-oriented cut. It's a boogie in Tolkachev's usual on-edge fashion, with buzzing textures and tense, bleeping melodies. But it comes across as too restrained for its own good, so it doesn't reach nearly the same heights as the distinctly powerful ""Blue Mood.""",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22091
She's Drunk - Subclubsciously,Through My Speakers,TMS005,Bass,January 2018,6,4.0,"She's Drunk's music can be skittish to a fault. Tugging at various strands of syncopated club music popular in the last half decade, the Berlin-based Frenchman packs his tracks with fitful detail. All the stuttering and convulsing can obscure, rather than strengthen, the producer's ideas, but he's found a steadier hand on his latest record for Through My Speakers. The freshest ingredient is its drums: roomy, live-sounding kits, full of shrill snares and plenty of space. Half of the EP satisfies itself with exploring these grooves. On ""Visions"" the loping low-end and claps are counterposed with a pealing lead line, while on ""Dancing Doubts,"" the EP's heaviest track, bird squawks and clipped shouts punctuate sly switch-up beat patterns.
 The EP's other half goes pop. ""Heart Burns"" is waterlogged with R&B samples without quite landing a hook—that old problem of his. ""Amadoda"" is much better, thanks to Sho Madjozi, a breakout star in her native South Africa with last year's gqom killer ""Dumi Hi Phone."" She playfully raps between English and Tsonga, painting a scene in which she is, indeed, drunk, and asking ""every single guy"" at the party if he could stay over. (The track's title translates to ""Men."") She's Drunk bolsters the groove with shreds of crispy breakbeat, but he keeps his fidgeting in check and lands a leftfield club anthem.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22055
Leslie Winer & Jay Glass Dubs - YMFEES,Bokeh Versions,BKV015,"Dub, Experimental",January 2018,1,4.0,"Speaking to The Wire recently, Dimitris Papadatos described his Jay Glass Dubs project as ""rewriting"" the history of dub. Perhaps in his parallel world Leslie Winer is a star. Her 1990 debut album, Witch, though barely acknowledged until its reappraisal at the start of this decade, is considered a key influence on trip-hop. The spare spoken-word style of Winer's classic recordings still sounds remarkably modern, as if it could have been plucked from any point in the dub timeline since the advent of sampling. This collaboration between two artists separated by generations and continents (Winer is American, though she lives in France) sounds as if a snaggly loose thread in the dub-space continuum has been stitched closed.
 The cosmic repercussions are considerable, as demonstrated on ""Woodshedded,"" a howling whirlwind of drum machine and supercharged delay stalked by Winer's glowering imagery. The panoramic ""About The Author"" is almost as intense, throbbing with dread weight. Both tracks deviate from Winer's trademark minimalist style (and from her other recent collaboration, a meditative hookup with experimental composer CM Von Hausswolff). The duo ease off on ""Cogged,"" whose kinda-industrial bassline and stoned head-nod vibe is closer to classic Winer. Further meditation comes from two instrumentals: the ashen ""Tin Mine"" and the stoned icy clank of ""#29."" But the mood remains intense, almost visionary, reaching its grand peak on ""No Famous Actors."" Winer's voice has a vocoder tang and the shuffling drums pass in confusing knots of delay. The whole thing shivers and smudges as if heard in a fever-dream—the sort where you lose track of time completely.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22051
Roman Flügel ‎- 1995,HardWorkSoftDrink,HWSD011,"Techno, Minimal",January 2018,10,4.1,"Records like Roman Flügel's 1995 show why the '90s were so exciting for house and techno. Blueprints were less established, so producers were more creative, unable to trawl through, say, YouTube for tracks to emulate. Scenes existed in relative isolation, which meant exciting sounds grew from close-knit circles of friends and collaborators, many linked to specific scenes. Few were more influential than Frankfurt's in the mid-'90s. Roman Flügel, then a little-known artist, was churning out tracks by the month, many harder and faster than the delicate sounds he releases today. Recent years have seen European minimalists look to this early period for inspiration, but its originality is tough to match.  1995, which collects three unreleased tunes from that era, finds Flügel in a typically cosmic headspace, putting a Frankfurt twist on the Daniel Bell school of minimal techno with three abstract but groovy tunes. Released by HardWorkSoftDrink, a Frankfurt collective that counts Flügel as one of their heroes, it's less about melody and more about messing with your head. ""Bibo,"" the EP's longest track, lands closest to Daniel Bell's technoid funk, thanks to its elastic bassline and oscillating synth. But the atmosphere is totally Flügel's, thanks to recurring chords that give this burrowing track a sentimental touch. It hits the artful balance of rhythm and melody that Flügel has further honed in the decades since.
 ""Party House"" has a similar mood. Its low-end is sparser and drums more persistent, chugging with an easy-going groove while bleeps dart around the mix. A stuttering drum tool with a whistling synth and shuffling percussion, ""Smell Flashback"" is Flügel at his headiest. Where his modern hits—like the melody-rich ""How To Spread Lies"" and ""Wilkie""—aim for the heart, 1995 is for the mind.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22063
Erik Slinge & Dirk De Akkers - Nieuwe Qniversum,Open Hand Real Flames,OHRF02D,Experimental,January 2018,Post a comment,3.8,"Ralph Cumbers, AKA Bass Clef, began his new label, Open Hand Real Flames, with two releases: a sinewy live jam and an EP from the Rotterdam-based producers Erik Slinge and Dirk De Akkers. The duo call the abstract club music they make ""Q."" It bears such a strong resemblance to Cumbers' own work that I assumed it was a sneaky new alias from him. Q, as presented on the duo's genre-blending debut EP, Nieuwe Qniversum, is a lively fusion of modern club music with influences from the electronic avant-garde.
 You can hear the influence of the UK's left-leaning dance floors on the lengthy ""Qristal Regenboog,"" where a punchy beat staggers underneath synth leads that wheel, zap and whine. But the duo's music has a clinical atmosphere, all blank space and smooth surfaces. The bass blankets the low-end like a cloud, and the duo sculpt unpredictable melodies that feel alive. The wobbly leads make ""Echt LeQQer"" sound like a Mark Fell track made of blubber. They delight in extreme sound manipulation elsewhere. The chime loop on ""QerQloQQen"" is mercilessly ripped apart and reassembled, a move more suited to an experimental artist than a dance floor act. But that's part of the reason why Nieuwe Qniversum is such a compelling debut.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22052
Peder Mannerfelt - The 3D Printed Songbook,Peder Mannerfelt,PM005,Experimental,January 2018,5,3.8,"There was a moment a couple of years back when you could barely move without stumbling over a vivid, adventurous new Peder Mannerfelt record. As he told Mark Smith, this fertile period came about after a rethinking of his production method: he shed ""mental baggage"" and learned not to sweat the details. The Swedish artist's output has since slowed, but the sounds and techniques hashed out back then still underpin what he does. The 3D Printed Songbook is full of asymmetric synth loops, unsettling drones and spicy technoid drums, fashioned into stark, intuitive arrangements that veer between punk attitude and capital-E experimental. This stuff is almost a genre unto itself at this point, and Mannerfelt's latest EP works as a neat primer.
 At the dance floor end of things, ""It's Coming"" is a convulsive techno banger with shades of breakcore mania. The broken beat swagger of ""Patient Boy"" demonstrates Mannerfelt's affinity with his recent collaborator Hodge. Elsewhere the EP turns tender. ""First Day"" is a hot-headed combo of twitching drum patterns and synth snarl bathed in cooling deep house chords. The soak gets deeper on ""You Had,"" where similar velvet chords toll over a vague ambient swirl. But Mannerfelt can't keep this up, and the track briefly shows its fangs near the end. The darker mode has tended to be more his thing, which he indulges on the doom-techno trudge ""Texas Is The Reason"" and on ""Against The Wall,"" a charcoal-black interlude painted in broad but effective brushstrokes.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22058
DJ JM - Cosa Nostra,Even The Strong,ETS001,Club,January 2018,Post a comment,4.1,"I've been waiting over a year for DJ JM's first EP to drop. The first I heard from the Lithuanian producer was his mix for The Astral Plane, a 45-minute tour de force of almost entirely original tunes (most of which are still sitting on his hard drive). It was one of 2016's most interesting mixes, staking out a singular approach to club music that owes as much to UK funky and South African gqom as it does to tribal house. All these styles emphasise big, in-your-face percussive grooves, and that's exactly what makes Cosa Nostra work.
 When it comes to stripped-back drum tools, every element has to be perfect. Not only does each sample have to stand out, but the levels and the compression must be finessed. DJ JM nails the technical aspect—the snares pack a wallop and the kick drums sink into the lower registers. The reverb is applied with a soft touch, which makes the drums feel alive without ruining the hard contours that make them smack. Over six minutes, ""Rainee"" barely adds or subtracts anything from the simple hand drum loop that forms its backbone, but the groove is so compelling that the energy never flags. Occasionally he introduces a shaker or a conga pattern, creating a subtle shift that rewires the rhythm.  ""Cosa Nostra"" is busier in terms of its arrangement, though not by much. He keeps it lively by peppering the drum track with effects and buzzing ambience, brief interjections that drift away as quickly as they appear. ""Interjail,"" the EP's standout track, recalls Lil Silva's best material, but with extra layers of interlocking syncopations that create depth and complexity. On ""Swatch"" DJ JM shows us his skill for pacing, with structural shifts that hit at exactly the right moment, infusing the track with new energy at every turn. Cosa Nostra is a formidable debut from a producer who may be one of this year's breakthrough artists, especially given the stockpile of dubs he's sitting on.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22050
Omar - Give Me No Dame,Cabaret Recordings,CABARET015,"Minimal, House, Techno",December 2017,Post a comment,4.0,"We first heard Omar Chibbaro's robotic shuffle on 2016's ""Vlegadno,"" a sprawling track released on a compilation EP through SUR. The Uruguayan artist stayed quiet until the last quarter of 2017, when he came through with an EP of trippy electro and minimal on Time Passages before finding a home on Cabaret in late December. Cabaret has put out some of the best minimal of the past few years and Give Me No Dame continues the trend.
 The record opens with the ghostly acidic bounce of ""Tsygan"" and its ribbiting vocal cuts. ""Damenongiveme"" starts as a minimal drum workout with precisely arranged snares, drum hits and sparse cymbals, but as it builds, delirious synth spirals knock it off its perfect balance, making things wonderfully wonky. The B-side channels a similarly hallucinogenic energy. ""Mundo,"" which features the warped android vocals of Nilufar Zarre, is strange and twinkling, while ""Belka"" is slow and rhythmic with scratchy drums and a squelchy funk. While there's a contrast between the acidic A-side and the sludgy depths of the B-side, both capture the energy of the more introspective moments in a set. Omar may be a relatively new name but his freaky grooves and knack for drowsy vocals may soon place him among minimal's best.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22045
Ben Vedren - MXA,Reduce Records,RED002,"Minimal, House",January 2018,Post a comment,3.5,"Ben Vedren played at Concrete, his home club in Paris, at least ten times last year. In other words, he's a reliable DJ. He's had a supporter in Cabanne for years and has production credits on Perlon, which should give you some idea of the subtlety of his productions. Like other minimal heads, his tracks disguise a lot of activity within steady yet gentle grooves. MXA is marked by considered, nuanced sound design, drifting by like a half-remembered dream. It makes its case with a whisper rather than a scream, combining suggestive yet abstract moods with drums soft and deep as a heartbeat.
 ""MXA"" and ""MXB"" have more character than your average minimal track. The latter has a particularly rich atmosphere, where rousing strings rise to the foreground only to be jerked from view. Men shout and metal clinks somewhere off in the distance, while the second half sounds like spring slowly drifting into an open window, with twinkling glockenspiels and rustling leaves. The other side has a straighter groove and is more upbeat, but there's still a lot going on. Modulating scribbles of sound dart between echoes and whispers, creating a teeming cyborg environment. It's the sort of track that slips subliminally into the mix, shifting the atmosphere and swing without emphatically announcing its presence.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22046
Lady Starlight - Which One Of Us Is Me?,Figure,FIGURE93,Techno,January 2018,7,3.5,"When Lady Starlight told Ryan Keeling that she likes her techno fast, she worried that this put her at odds with the current status quo. In the eight months since that interview, things appear to have changed. Several defining currents in 2017—the rise of electro, the bleed of hardcore into techno, and the increasingly adventurous selections of mainstage DJs like Nina Kraviz—conspired to make dance floors pacier places than they've been in a while. Starlight's second EP—mean BPM circa 138—slots into this context without offering any surprises. Her production method, linked to her better-known live set, favours simple arrangements. (She told Keeling that her mixer limited her to three channels per track.) Which One Of Us Is Me?, for Len Faki's Figure, is even simpler than last year's Untitled EP for Stroboscopic Artefacts, vacuuming out those tracks' reverbed spaces for a set of no-frills tools for our speedy new reality.
 ""You,"" with its EBM-shaded arp, offers a smidgen of breathing space at the opening, but after that Starlight's ideas come stacked remorselessly end-to-end. ""Me""'s slamming kick and angry synths hint at the Birmingham sound of her sometime collaborator Surgeon. ""Them"" tilts towards Robert Hood with its hypnotic chord stabs, which periodically blur and dimensionalise as if we're switching between 2 and 3D renderings. That and some hi-hat layering are the track's only variation. The same goes for ""Us"", which is the same track with the furniture dragged around. The chords drop a tone, the kick drum bulks up and Starlight squeezes a drop more euphoria out of her frazzled high-velocity grooves.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22048
Felix Da Housecat - Founders Of Filth Volume Three,Founders Of Filth,FOF003,"Electroclash, House, Techno",December 2017,Post a comment,3.4,"Electroclash might be in the dustbin, but its spirit lives on through DJs like Daniel Avery, Erol Alkan and Dave Clarke. New electroclash productions are harder to find, which makes Felix Da Housecat's new EP all the more interesting. One of the chief proponents of the style, the US artist pushes a more house-compatible sound than many of his synth-loving peers, which means you probably hear his tracks more often than you might realise (I once saw DJ Koze send Panorama Bar into meltdown with 2009's ""Kickdrum""). ""Energy,"" the main cut from Founders Of Filth Volume Three, feels straight out of 2005, with an arpeggio synth, a goofy drug-related vocal and a poppy sheen. The vibe is best on the ""Extended Mix,"" where the cosmic mood after the blissful breakdown runs for that little bit longer.  ""Color Of Rayy,"" which comes under Felix Da Housecat's Aphrohead alias, is another highlight. The kind of track you might hear in a Claude VonStroke sunrise set, it's dreamy, catchy and just on the right of cheesy, with nimble percussion and plenty of bleeps and blops. The recurring blast of haze recalls the stoned sound of last year's excellent ""Camile From OHM Makes Me Feel Loved"" by Machine Woman. ""They Just Want 2 B U,"" featuring Jamie Principle, is the EP's mellowest track, a nocturnal groover that kicks at a leisurely 118 BPM.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22127
Goldie & Skepta - Upstart,Metalheadz,METASKP1,Drum & Bass,December 2017,1,3.1,"""'Upstart' is for everyone who hates the fake shit, the crass commercial crapola, the fucked-up state of everything. It's pyrotechnic protest music for the hip at heart."" This might be classic Goldie—verbose, unfettered—but you can't help but think that he's shot himself in the foot with this press release. Would ""God Save The Queen"" have riled up so many people if Johnny Rotten had divulged its barbed message beforehand? Probably not. The power of a great protest song is that the music speaks for itself.  ""Upstart (Road Trip)"" is a collaboration between two artists who, for all the transgressive nature of their early output, are now firmly established within mainstream music: Goldie received an MBE in 2016; a year later, Skepta did a a tune with Mick Jagger. ""Upstart"" was never likely to be as raw as the two of them hoped, though it's not a bad record. Goldie's 140-BPM breakbeat, built from live drums and embellished with ghostly strings, hits hard, while Skepta's flow is typically sharp and fluid, if lacking in bite.
 By contrast, ""Poisonous Darts,"" a collaboration between Goldie, newcomer Fraims and the veteran MC DRS, is all about the vocal, with DRS's Northern twang and dark poetry (""Ghost in the mind of a martian / trapped in the body of a Spartan"") giving the track its edge. The instrumental trumps ""Upstart (Road Trip),"" too, as darting drums barrel beneath horn-like sirens and the occasional stroke of what sounds like a sitar. It isn't going to set the world on fire, but then no one said it would.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22047
Kosh - Null 212,Casa Voyager,CSV02,Electro,January 2018,9,3.5,"2017 was a big year for electro. As we outlined in our year-end summary, DJ Stingray and Helena Hauff were the stars, but they were just the visible tip of ""a very large iceberg."" There was tons of activity below the surface, spread all over the globe—even in unlikely places like Morocco. The Casablanca label Casa Voyager and its trio of dispersed affiliates, Driss Bennis (OCB), Jonas Bengio (Viewtiful Joe) and Youssef Benjelloun (Kosh), were among the torrent of new electro slingers to emerge in 2017. Starting with a breezy mixtape, In Loving Memory Of Ambition, which also featured hip-hop and drum & bass by Bennis and Bengio (under different aliases), Casa Voyager released their first proper EP last summer, a compilation with contributions from all three friends. Null 212 sees Benjelloun step up for his first full solo outing.
 Compared with his labelmates, Kosh favours a more purist electro sound, and Detroit homage prevails on Null 212. His tracks for Casa Voyager's first EP were deep, warm and dreamy, much like The Other People Place, and a similar vibe props up the B-side here. ""Bug In The System"" is especially luscious, with lullaby overtones and a funky groove. The highlight is ""Null 212."" Spine-tingling AFX acid-like melodies, noodly funk riffs and fidgety breaks combine to make one of the first knockout electro tracks of 2018. Hopefully there's more weird, forward-thinking electro to come.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22033
Hodge - Beneath Two Moons,Berceuse Heroique,BH046,Techno,January 2018,5,3.8,"Jacob Martin commented on his hyperactive release schedule in a 2015 interview: ""I just wanted to be really visible for a bit."" Almost three years later, he's still one of the most ubiquitous artists on the UK scene. In 2017 he played out almost every weekend while finding time to release four EPs. He has a distinctive sound but continues to experiment, like on his 2016 ambient release or last year's unhinged collaboration with Peder Mannerfelt. Martin's latest for Berceuse Heroique signals another departure, adopting a more measured pace and laying on synths thick with '80s flavour.
 The A-side contains the record's darker club material. ""Beneath Two Moons"" plays like Tessela's ""With Patsy,"" albeit straightened out and slowed to a menacing crawl. With echoing screams and a satisfied exhale, vocals give it a sensuous gloss, while the fizzing synth lead pushes the tension to breaking point. ""There Is A Storm Coming In"" is more boisterous, anchored to martial drums and a serrated bassline. Martin's attention to sound design shines on the B-side. The central melody on the airy house cut, ""Don't Hold Your Breath,"" and ""All Is Not Lost""'s stark bassline show how deftly he textures his productions, which pull sounds out of shape and twist them. It gives every element a unique character.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22044
Tropical Interface - Orchid,Hyperboloid Records,HYPR056,"Experimental Club, Eco-Grime",December 2017,5,4.1,"I was floored when I heard ""New Combat Drone."" from the Russian producer Tropical Interface.Here was an artist with a style of experimental club music that felt harder, more agile and more dynamic than most, and I had never heard of him before. He is part of a loose collective of producers who describe their music as ""eco-grime,""—futuristic dance music concerned with an ecological utopia.
 That doesn't mean nature samples. This music is more like a terrarium: artificial material surrounding an idealised representation of nature. More practically, eco-grime means a predilection for bright sounds and melodies amidst the percussive blitz, along with attractive, green-hued imagery. It cuts up grime, Jersey club, ballroom and IDM with blink-and-you'll-miss-it finesse.
 Each of Orchid's seven tracks is strong, but there are a few highlights. ""Extract"" boasts a chaotic drum pattern that makes the quiet moments stand out like the ominous silence in a thriller film, while ""Reserve"" features arpeggiated leads that whirr like they're caught in a cyclone. MIDI flute rubs up against shards of vocal, distant gun cocks and other familiar sounds on ""Planet Genome,"" which is essentially experimental club music thrown into a food processor. ""Amnesia,"" which stretches out the percussive pyrotechnics into a seven-minute epic, proves that Tropical Interface's style isn't just about bluster and attack. Accomplishing a lot in under 30 minutes, this is a club music record that will make your head spin.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22036
FaltyDL - Three Rooms,Hypercolour,HYPE068,Breakbeat,January 2018,4,3.2,"Whatever form FaltyDL's music takes—garage, hip-hop, hardcore, and plenty else—you can usually count on finding an appealing tenderness. It's more pronounced when his music wanders from the dance floor, as on his last album, Heaven Is For Quitters, but it was also there on EPs like the excellent Not For Press, which softened AFX-style drums with lotion-like drops of melody. The results on his latest EP, Three Rooms, sometimes show the limits of this tendency to sooth. Take the organ riff on ""Big Room."" It adopts a rowdy pose, but the watery reverb and mulchy low-end dampen its enthusiastic gestures.
 Lustman sounds more at home in the smaller ""rooms."" ""Medium Sized Room""'s synth lead and vocal are pleasingly bright and nimble, but it's not without flaws. The atmospheric intro and outro seem incidental to what's in between, and the track's interplay can feel too orderly. ""Small Room (Fake Smiling Faces)"" plays to Lustman's strengths. The down-pitched sample, from Undisputed Truth's ""Smiling Faces Sometimes,"" and the jarring horn lend an anxiously soulful feel, at which Lustman excels.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22041
Redshape - Blink,NonPlus+,NONPLUS044,Techno,January 2018,Post a comment,2.7,"Sebastian Kramer looks to his live sets for inspiration. He's made some of the most powerful tunes in his catalogue by rebuilding tracks from performances. With ""Blink,"" which has been part of his set in some form for over two years, the trend looks to continue. But this time Kramer struggles to translate the dynamism of a live performance onto record.
 The nearly ten-minute track has the makings of an anthem. There's an insistent synth lead, heart-tugging arps and a dramatic breakdown, but as much ground as the track covers, it doesn't feel like it goes anywhere. It stays flat with little in the way of tension or build-up. The ""Tunnel Mix,"" inspired by the Paris club of the same name, doesn't help things, giving ""Blink"" a serviceable big-room makeover without much pizazz. Blink aims for the rafters but never gets off the ground.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22040
"Minimum Syndicat, Sunil Sharpe - Joyless Euphoria",Minimum Syndicat,MS009,Techno,January 2018,Post a comment,3.7,"The Parisian duo Minimum Syndicat do '90s rave with a grisly modern twist. They take banging techno back to its filthy acid and electro roots, completing the circle with a nasty paranoia that can only be from this century: hard, dark and sometimes incredibly trippy. A decade ago they launched a self-titled label for their old-meets-new-school sound, inviting a different guest artist on each record. In recent years they've stepped outside the label for releases, so Joyless Euphoria, featuring Sunil Sharpe on the A-side, is their first appearance on Minimum Syndicat in years.
 You can always count on Sharpe to deliver something squiffy, and his two tracks, ""The Tunnel Master"" and ""Rope To String,"" don't disappoint. They're the joyful side of Joyless Euphoria. The first is pleasantly gloopy with fun, bubbling sounds, while the other is a pranging electro-techno track with sombre undertones. Minimum Syndicat's ""Mass Evacuation"" lets a storm of spangled synth notes and acid stabs loose over a barrage of distorted kicks. It's not their most interesting track but it's fearsomely functional. ""Nosebleed"" is a better example of their apocalypse rave aesthetic. Emulating The Mover with an edgy kid of euphoria, it's a chemically induced high that's on the turn—things are about to get bad.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22030
Sully - Untitled,Bedouin,BAS002,"UK Bass, Dancehall, Jungle",November 2017,1,3.9,"With ten years and a ton of releases behind him, the British producer Sully is a child of the hardcore continuum. That tendency is probably what linked him to Bastakiya Tapes—the first three vinyl releases on the Bedouin Records sub-label all featured breakbeats of some kind. ""Untitled 01"" is a hard stepper of dirty dancehall fuzz. Distortion touches every element, from the percussion hits to the squelchy bass and siren bleeps, ripples and blares. There's even a background drone that sounds like you haven't quite fully tuned into the right radio frequency, a fun sonic hallucination in the midst of a full-on get-down.  The B-side, ""Stripes On A Tiger Don't Wash Away,"" is meatier. It builds from a piercing, almost melancholy melody to a hardcore rave banger with plenty of bells and whistles, including a ""Mentasm"" hoover. With a mood between euphoria and introspection, that central melody is a thread that evolves throughout the track. These two tunes make an energetic and substantial package.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22037
Trancemaster - Neptune's Orb,Transatlantic,TAR003,"Techno, Trance",December 2017,2,3.8,"Transatlantic released three 12-inches last year, and it's as if they were all made for a single DJ set. They hover at intense tempos (somewhere between 135 and 150 BPM), with a retro flex that feels more genuine than most nostalgic rave tracks. The first release, from the Dutch producer Nthng, blended sentimental trance and dub techno, while the second, Europa's Facegrinder EP, conjured crunchy acid lines and electro breaks. Trancemaster's self-titled EP, as the title might suggest, channels the big-room euphoria of '90s trance and progressive house, evened out with a dash of Detroit techno.
 On ""Neptune's Orb"" Trancemaster has the guts to lead with a three-minute build-up before the kick drum hits. It's easy to imagine the warehouse rafters rattling to the rhythm of its melodic bassline, and while you shouldn't rinse it too early in the night, it's bound to have a big effect as a peak-time bomb. ""Nord-Spedition"" is subtler, with a patient 15-minute arc and a warm kick drum that thumps gently instead of knocking you in the face. ""Trance Xode"" would fit right in alongside early Plastikman, with its automaton bassline and 909 banging at 142 BPM. Trancemaster rounds off the record with a hauntingly beautiful ambient number that recalls some of the synth work in Hans Zimmer's soundtrack for Blade Runner 2049. It will come in handy if you're looking for something dramatic to begin a DJ set.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22034
Physical Therapy - Time Saving Tips For DJs Vol. 1,Exotic Dance Records,EDR007,"House, Breaks",January 2018,1,3.6,"Daniel Fisher's music is marked by its mood rather its style. His tastes touch dance floors from New York to Berlin, and even his most greyscale techno has a winking sense of humour. That twist makes his discography feel cohesive, even as he jumps all over the map. Time Saving Tips For DJs Vol. 1 collects some of Fisher's potent DJ tools, which are brimming with personality and colour in spite of their functional purpose.  A few of these tunes remind me of Kirk The Flirt & Peter Pressure, a project Fisher aired a couple of years ago to combine his love of fast-paced techno with blissful disco melodies. ""Down Down"" is one of them, with springy drums and a walking bassline looped into a conniption. ""Lunch Break"" is the other highlight, doing for early rave music what ""Down Down"" does for disco, whittling it down into a blunt-force tool. ""Group Think"" has a surprising shift from dub techno drama into piano house frenzy. It might be too silly for some DJs, and the raw ""Love's Theme 2014"" sounds half-finished. But even that ultra-barebones track isn't boring.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22032
Mor Elian - Fairplex Drive,Radio Matrix,RAMX11,Electro,December 2017,2,4.0,"A DJ before she was a producer, Mor Elian's tracks have tended towards the utilitarian. Last year, on releases for Delft and Fever AM, the Israeli artist injected more personality and pungent mood into her minimalist productions. Like the Delft record, Elian's latest—and best—EP focusses on electro. But where Miracle Mind Program had a lighter sway, Fairplex Drive is linear and angst-filled. Its four tracks are ""inspired by the adventures of two ancient souls travelling for four days on planet earth."" Rainforests and cityscapes are implied, but mostly Elian seems to linger in the deserts of her sometime home, California, and their alien landscapes with hints of the extraterrestrial. One moment we're coasting down ""Gamma Gulch,"" the walls closing steadily in while the starscape above—a Terrence Dixon-style canopy of flickering arps—is obscured by ever darker clouds. And then the landscape opens out onto ""Starlight Mesa,"" a broad expanse marked by stark lead lines and roaming chords.
 These two tracks form the EP's central drama, and the latter one hints at a stronger emotion—determination, maybe. The rest of the record remains creepily ambiguous. On ""Fairplex Drive"" and ""Ruby,"" laser-sharp lead lines wriggle like glowworms over pristine drums and chord hush. These tracks haven't lost the DJ-malleability of Elian's past records, but they're as fresh as anything.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21916
Catharsis - A Purging of Demons,Zhark Recordings Berlin,ZHARK029,Techno,January 2018,2,3.5,"Since rebooting a few years back, Zhark Recordings has become a go-to label for murky, introspective techno. It releases music made for dance floors without being beholden to them. The label's boss, Kareem, has turned in some of the best electronic soundscapes of his career, while longtime alley David Foster, AKA Huren, debuted another pulverising techno alias, MRTVI. There have also been new signings through Manchester's Casual Violence and the Canadian duo Stärker. Catharsis is a box-fresh collaboration between two solo producers that, like the music of Casual Violence and Stärker, ploughs the rich grey zone between industrial techno and dark ambient.  Lurking at around 120 BPM and laden with gothic, pseudo-mystic titles, A Purging Of Demons is a solemn record that shouldn't be consumed casually. (No Zhark record should, for that matter.) This is pure techno, purged of hedonistic excess, with results as austere and grimly unforgiving as that sounds. The slow concrete grind of tracks like ""Bringing Forth The Hellchild"" wear into submission, and even after a single listen the record leaves you drained. It's intentional, though. Catharsis are here to contest and to challenge, not to stupefy. The flash of a melody in ""Summoning The Black Tongue"" offers one of very few palliative moments, while the lead track, ""Perception Through The Circle,"" offers a few more hooks. For a lighter but no less heady morsel, skip to Kareem's digital-only remix. A Purging of Demons isn't for everybody, but everybody should hear it.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22031
Omar-S - Tap Dat Ass,FXHE Records,AOS808,House,December 2017,15,3.0,"From his ""Ricardo Willawobo"" moment, to his stone-faced DJ appearances, to track titles like ""You Silk Suit Wearin Mulafuk'ka"" or ""Here's Your Trance, Now Dance!!,"" Alex O. Smith has an unfiltered quality to his persona that's most often passed for charisma. On his latest EP, though, it feels more like a liability. In isolation, the name Tap Dat Ass might be redeemed by the title track's tap dancing samples. But combined with other bits on the cover—most notably the text ""I GOTTA BIG DICK 2 MUTHAFUKKA!"" next to a random mug shot—it makes him seem less like a mysterious bad boy and more like a creep, or even the ""Annoying Mumbling Alkaholik"" he skewered in another title.
 The music is more polite—too much so, in fact. The title track has all the hallmarks of classic Omar-S: plodding beat, white-hot hi-hats, a general feeling of being bashed out in one take. The tap dancing, sampled along with its original soundtrack, makes for a decent hook, especially when Smith starts chopping it up, Soundstream-style. ""Odawa,"" meanwhile, could use a hook—its stripped-back disco-house arrangement is nice enough but it seems to set the stage for something that never arrives. As with a lot of his music over the past few years (setting aside his killer LP, The Best!), this record has the ingredients of Smith's best music but not the personality.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22035
Hank Jackson - Untitled,anno,ANNO001,"Techno, Ambient",December 2017,9,4.0,"Along with compatriots Anthony Naples and Huerco S., Hank Jackson was at the crest of the deluge of scuzzy house coming from New York around 2013. Initial missives for Mister Saturday Night and Proibito were built around suitably deteriorated stompers, but there was always an extra dosage of quirk in his work. Where many contemporaries used saturation as an aesthetic cloak, Jackson juxtaposed grizzled textures with flair and nuance. Although his early work showed much promise, in the intervening years he's kept his head down and refined his craft.  The wait appears to have paid off. ""Gacx"" feels like a Timedance production that's been left in the oven but the structure is as tracky as a minimal record. It touches on the rhythmic dexterity of ""Chicken Fried Shrimp"" and ""Mongoos"" but there's more air in the mix, retaining his signature overheated aesthetic while suggesting wider spaces than usual. The criss-crossing beat seems to turn inside-out while sizzling effects create a dynamic energy that makes the track feel like it's breathing. The minor-key pad behind it all produces a sense of resigned melancholy that's perfect for the tail-end of an intense set.  While some might overlook the B-side, its two beatless tracks foreground Jackson's knack for unique textures. At full volume, ""Snake Pit"" can stand toe-to-toe with a noisy Tim Hecker production, while ""oebbbbbbb"" conjures the calm warmth of amniotic fluid, the trickling and bubbling of water and the slush of seafoam. Jackson seems to deliberately be sidestepping the limelight with this low-key release but it's his most mature record by a clear margin.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22014
Jensen Interceptor & Assembler Code ‎- 6th Element,Boysnoize Records,BNR172,Electro,December 2017,1,3.6,"Since 2012, the Australian producer Jensen Interceptor, AKA Mikey Melas, has been plying his trade on the local Motorik label. Melas's work hasn't gone unnoticed, with recent appearances on international labels Space Factory, Central Processing Unit and Zone. This time Melas teams up with another Australian producer, Assembler Code. They're partners in the lo-fi house project Anthony Fade, having released on labels like Lost Palms and Shall Not Fade. On 6th Element, released on Boysnoize Records, they've departed from the warmth of house and leant in to shades of EBM, a sound that's lately found itself back in vogue.
 On ""2231"" an arpeggiated synth lead plays over kicks and claps. On ""Runner"" that combination is more compelling, with trippy bleeps and scintillating breakbeat loops. ""6th Element"" steps back from EBM, ending up more like a functional lo-fi house track reminiscent of the duo's Anthony Fade project, albeit quicker. ""FM Expander"" takes inspiration from classic electro, dialing it down a notch with shuffling kicks and odd details. It doesn't quite hold a candle to its forebears, but that classic feeling is there.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22015
Terrence Dixon ‎- No More Time,lower parts,LP15,Techno,December 2017,2,4.0,"With just a few elements, Terrence Dixon makes some of the most musical minimal techno out there. It's also some of the trippiest. His tracks are never straightforward, burrowing into your brain with abstract bleeps, morphing basslines and intricate drum patterns, and dazzling with delicacy rather than force. This approach makes for powerful dance floor moments, such as those his latest EP, No More Time, has offered since its December release. Its four untitled tracks are impressively varied, ranging from tribal to alien jazz, anchored to blunt kick drums that sit deep in the mix. The tracks are mostly without DJ-friendly intros and outros, which adds to their otherworldly charm.  By techno's modern standards, these tracks feel unconventional. They don't build up or down, feeling more like snippets of studio sessions than fully fleshed ideas. That doesn't make them less effective, but it means DJs will need to be smart to get the most out of them. Take the best track here, the B2. Euphoric yet utterly mind-bending, it starts abruptly, looping a cosmic bell synth and a syncopated clap pattern. It features the EP's only notable breakdown, a respite from the track's psychedelic churn. The other dance tracks—A2, A3, B1—are even more abstract, mixing gentle rhythms with hissing, jazzy melodies. Few producers appeal to the feet and mind like Terrence Dixon.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22029
Organ Tapes - Into One Name,Genome6.66Mbp,GNM005,"Experimental Club, Hip-Hop, Pop",December 2017,Post a comment,4.2,"Emo was everywhere in 2017. Pivotal bands reunited, new outfits formed and a generation of hip-hop artists raised on the style brought it to rap music. Emo is also appearing in dance music, thanks to artists such as Organ Tapes. Through crews like Bala Club and Tobago Tracks, Tim Zha has close connections to the experimental club scene, but he makes bedroom hip-hop with sing-songy mumbles that should be familiar to anyone who had a downtrodden teenage phase.
 If there's anything that Zha shares with emo rappers like Lil Uzi Vert and Lil Peep, it's the ability to make music that feels both DIY and polished. His autotuned mushmouth means that only half of his lyrics are intelligible, but his melodies drip with feeling. You don't have to understand everything on ""Di Qiu,"" which features the sound of something like a Mellotron, nor do you need to decipher the lyrics on the tropical ""Li Bu Kai.""
 Zha's production on Into One Name is laced with intricate details. He embeds the infamous beat to Clipse's ""Grindin"" into guitar-based emo on ""New,"" while ""Something"" uses a bit-crushed synth that'll take you right back to 2001, dreaming of Evan and Chan. Even the opener, ""Rust,"" essentially just piano and acoustic guitar, carries a certain majesty despite Zha sounding drunk, barely enunciating his words. Sounding tossed-off yet profound is Into One Name's greatest triumph. On the upbeat closer, ""Streets,"" Zha rides the broken beat like waves, coming off somewhere between a rapper and an R&B singer. It's hard to pin down what Zha is—singer-songwriter, rapper, producer, emo raconteur? He's maybe all of those and none of those.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22012
Cassy & Demuir - Please Me (Fred P Reshape Project),Kwench Records,KWR002,House,December 2017,Post a comment,3.7,"In the run-up to the November launch of Cassy's new label, Kwench Records, a press release outlined its manifesto: ""Two or more artists will collaborate on an EP of original material, with a further artist joining the package on remix duty."" It didn't take long for things to move off-script—the debut 12-inch, Cassy & Demuir's Please Me, didn't include any remixes. Instead, the label announced Please Me (Fred P Reshape Project), a separate EP that was given its own release after Cassy couldn't choose between the New Yorker's submissions. Listening to the three tracks, it was a smart move.  Cassy's decision was possibly made harder (or easier?) by how varied the remixes are. That said, though they barely resemble the jacking electroid original, all three could work in the club, albeit at different points of the night. The ""Journey Mix,"" the longest and best cut, is for early mornings and weary legs, its earthy percussion, silky synths and languid, winding groove urging you to plant your feet and gently sway.
 Tighter and with a snapping pulse, the ""Fixation Mix"" is more direct, the kind of track Fred P might use to bridge the gap between dreamier fare and a low-slung '90s gem. The ""Broken Vibes Mix,"" a lopsided roller punctuated by what sounds like stars cascading from the sky, makes canny use of Cassy's vocals, dicing and splicing them for added feeling. Its serene vibe feels suited to an early evening warm-up slot, though as Cassy's recent XLR8R podcast showed, in the right hands it can also make for a classy final tune.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22013
Ozo - Anambra,Isle Of Jura,ISLE004,Disco,December 2017,2,3.9,"Buddhism first surfaced in Western rock, pop and jazz in the late '60s. In 1967, David Bowie released ""Silly Boy Blue,"" singing about reincarnation and ""yak butter statues."" Pharoah Sanders called his 1969 album Karma. By the early '70s, Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter were practicing Buddhists. The psych-rock band Gong took the faith less seriously, but their Radio Gnome Invisible albums allude to various Buddhist tenets. John Lennon summed up this enthusiasm with what for Buddhists must have seemed a bullish turn of phrase: ""Instant karma's gonna get you / gonna knock you off your feet!""  It's hard to say how fresh Ozo's ""Listen To The Buddha,"" a minor hit from the band's debut LP, might've felt by 1976, but neither its reggae rock nor its spiritual messages was subtly delivered. (The band performed the song on TV alongside a large Buddha statue.) ""Anambra,"" released on the same album and reissued here by Isle Of Jura, is far better. Its lovely vocal harmonies soar over tambourines, church bells, flutes and nyabinghi drumming, a steady, hypnotic rhythm pioneered by the Rastafarian band leader Count Ossie.
 In the song's second half, you can hear Ozo's cofounder Keni St. George chanting a Sanskrit Buddhist mantra: ""Om mani padme hum."" It's easy to imagine how transcendent this all might've felt at The Loft, where David Mancuso apparently closed some sets with ""Anambra."" ""Anambra River,"" first released in the early '80s, is a busier mix—the bells and vibraphones are brighter, the chant more insistent. It's a fine version, but it's no match for the serenely rousing original.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22011
Talker - Battle Standards Remixes,Standards &amp; Practices,STANDPRAC03,Techno,November 2017,2,3.8,"Brian Kolada once called Karl Meier's credentials ""impeccable,"" a claim easily supported by the tracklist of Battle Standards Remixes, the third record on his label with Johnathan Krohn, Standards & Practices. To rework their recent EP as Talker, Meier and Krohn called in an impressive cast of artists—namely Surgeon, Broken English Club and Regis, with whom they have a particularly close history (Talker has released music on Downwards, and Meier once spent a year in the UK working at Regis's distribution company, Integrale Muzique). The result is a dynamic EP that shows some of techno's most influential artists in fine form.  Talker's ""Battle Standard"" is a rumbling bit of industrial techno with just the right balance of grit and atmosphere. Surgeon's remix is more ruthless, trading the original's cavernous atmosphere for a denser, noisier mix. Regis, ever the groove architect, reshapes the track into something nimble and almost breaky, building a fearsome momentum behind its leaden kick. Oliver Ho reimagines the stuttering rhythm of ""Snub Nose"" as a post-punk beat, then completes the picture with a distorted bass guitar, wailing feedback and Alan Vega-style vocals—a well-executed curveball. Also included is ""My Favorite Color Is Gold,"" a sinister abyss of ambient noise that originally appeared on the 2015 Downwards compilation The Immortal Eye. Be it the founders or their friends, Standards & Practices have some extraordinary talents at their disposal.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22009
The Persuader & Nima Khak ‎- Aftermath,Stockholm LTD,STHLMLTD048,Techno,December 2017,Post a comment,3.4,"There a housey bounce to Jesper Dahlbäck's modern productions even though he said goodbye to the style years ago. Compared to the barrelling techno he makes now, his time spent as one of the Lords Of Svek across the late '90s and early '00s was especially sunny, with tribal-tinged grooves and hazy atmospheres. Every now and then one of Dahlbäck's techno tracks recall the slinky grooves of that era, the latest being ""System Penetration 100"" from his new Aftermath collaboration with Nima Khak. It's a straight-up techno tune, but its sparse arrangement and bubbling synth give it the dead-eye groove of an ethereal '90s tech house bomb. That said, that bludgeoning kick drum and sub-bass are the kind of things only techno DJs will get to unleash on a dance floor.  The EP's other tracks are more abrasive. ""Shameless Intrusion"" has a cosmic atmosphere similar to ""System Penetration 100"" but with a grainy sheen. A lively acid line and beefed-up kick makes the second half vaguely euphoric before the ambient outro brings it home. The kick-free ""Aftermath"" is a handy option for DJs opening a party, the ambient equivalent of a nighttime stroll through a leaking abandoned warehouse.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22010
Jex Opolis - Human Emotion,Good Timin',GDTIMIN011,"House, Funk",December 2017,Post a comment,4.1,"On his latest EP, Jered Stuffco invites a distracted lover—""never mind what's on TV,"" he pleads on the title track—to feel some ""human emotion."" If the musical range here is anything to go by, Stuffco is in close touch with his own. Its tracks draw from funk, disco, soft rock and R&B with a suaveness that recalls Metro Area. Stuffco is smooth, but not coolly so—on ""Human Emotion""'s vocal and dub versions, he sings like a puppyish Michael McDonald.  Human Emotion's instruments are equally expressive. In fact, Stuffco's musicianship has rarely felt as rich as it does here. On many of his previous tracks, the leads were usually the focal points, with tracky rhythms and harmonies in supporting roles. By contrast, every part of ""Fifth Wind"" draws the ear. Sighing vocal synths, electric piano and springy basslines echo the upwardly mobile utopia of Japanese City Pop, and a melodious 303 whistles along. The B-side tracks also impress. On ""Botanico,"" vocal harmonies glide above vibraphones and organs, with another great bassline underneath. Glistening electric piano chords set the tone on the New York house-evoking ""Infinity Room,"" whose keys roam as freely as the title suggests.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22008
LNS & DJ Sotofett - Blot,Wania,WANIATRE3,"House, Techno, Ambient",December 2017,1,3.5,"For such a singular and eccentric artist, DJ Sotofett has always worked well with others—consider the raft of collaborators on his first LP, the live band on this year's Twotinos, or the countless producers he's teamed up with over the years on Sex Tags Mania and its various offshoots. Lately, his most common coproducer has been Laura Sparrow, the Vancouver artist better known as LNS. Following an EP on Freakout Cult (the label run by Jayda G and Sotofett's brother, Fett Burger), Sparrow teamed up with the Sex Tags founder last year for a twinkling ambient cut called ""Soft Peak Mix."" They've made a habit of it since then, knocking out three more EPs released as a series on Wania, culminating in December with Blot.  Blot presents one track in three versions, all of which, according to the record's credits, show the two artists working together but with distinct roles: Sotofett on drum programming, Sparrow on keys. This is easy to hear in the music. Thudding away at north of 130 BPM, the blunt drums echo Sotofett's memorably titled Philip Sherburne, Your Word Should Be Worth More Than The Ignorance Of Pitchfork, while ""Blot (Extended Mix)"" and the ambient ""Fuge Mix"" have the richly cosmic chords and melodies that seem to be LNS's calling card—the mournful synths, falling slowly like flares in the distance, are this record's single best detail. If those two are about atmosphere, the ""Techno Mix"" is all impact, adding a thick bassline and the occasional drum fill to Sotofett's airless drum arrangement. It's a fierce and effective club cut, but the synths on the B-side, as somber as they are sci-fi, are what bring this record to life.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22007
Jimi Tenor & Freestyle Man - Sleepover,Studio Barnhus,BARN056,House,November 2017,6,4.0,"What ever happened to the house music virtuoso? A quick look through RA's best tracks of 2017 reveals a surfeit of tracky productions, breaks and experimental music. There's barely a keyboard solo or a hand-played instrument. It's this state of affairs that leaves producers like Lars Bartkuhn, Byron The Aquarius and Jimi Tenor swimming upstream. Their music is indebted to the in-the-pocket skills required for jazz and funk, not in-the-box sound design. However, the omnivorous dance floor listener or DJ does themselves a disservice ignoring their output.
 Take Tenor for instance. The Finnish mainstay has released a staggering amount of excellent, often overlooked material in the last few years—for starters, a vocal house album as part of Cola & Jimmu and two albums with the UMO Jazz Orchestra. Perhaps the Studio Barnhus team can point people in the right direction. He's linked up with his old collaborator Freestyle Man for the Sleepover EP on the Swedish label.
 Tenor and Freestyle Man (born Klas-Henrik Lindblad) first appeared together on a couple of the former's mid-'90s 12-inches, released Tenor's Sähkö Recordings sublabel, Puu. They still sound on top of their game 20 years later. These tracks burst with memorable chord progressions, masterful leads and vocal hooks. In terms of the vocals, Tenor is not Romanthony, but ""Pyjama Party""'s lyrics—""Call your mommy you won't be home tonight... Oh what a night it's gonna be, hanging out with friends in the nightclub""—are so silly and pure you'll forgive the thin quality of his voice. ""Temple Of Music"" and ""Turku"" include flute trills, Metro Area-style synth bass and in the former case, a towering chorus on the healing properties of dance music. These are virtuosic tunes expressing the simple, utopic promise of house.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21956
Powell - New Beta Vol. 2,Diagonal Records,DIAG041,Experimental,November 2017,4,3.5,"""The idea of [New] Beta was that it's a work-in-progress."" Powell, speaking late last year to Radar Radio, also suggested the series—vinyl-only and, unlike some past releases, inconspicuously promoted—allowed him the freedom to experiment without the pressure of expectation. As Powell's description suggests, the results find him in a state of flux. Though the DNA of his music remains—jagged, reverb-free synths, the playful harshness of early '80s electronic music—the sound on New Beta Vol. 2 is sparser and, in a few cases, more expansive. ""Strobe""'s sour synth melody is transportive, a feeling you'd rarely associate with Powell. The flat, dissonant notes on ""PosTAe,"" meanwhile, echo Aphex Twin.  IDM isn't the only nod here. ""Drumz VIP""'s breaks and spasms of snares, vocals and bass amount to an abstract take on drum & bass. ""Rudeboy, Let's Funk,"" another highlight, is '90s hardcore as imagined by Cabaret Voltaire. The execution across New Beta Vol. 2 is up and down, but more often than not the ideas are compelling. ""PosTAe"" and ""Strobe"" dabble promisingly with melody and atmosphere, as does ""Slippy Pig,"" whose sliminess floods the bass and dial-twisted squalls. New Beta Vol. 2's shortcomings seem tied to the exploratory method Powell has applied. (This mini-album, like the last one, was written using recently acquired polyphonic hardware.) ""Slippy Pig"" takes a while to get going and ""Sneak 2_05""'s simple arps and drums feel undercooked. New Beta Vol. 2 isn't an essential record, but it's strong enough to bode well for whatever follows.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22005
Rudeboyz - Gqomwave,Goon Club Allstars,GCA007,Gqom,November 2017,Post a comment,4.1,"As the first gqom artists to release internationally a few years back, Rudeboyz are considered originators in their native Durban scene, and their primal music is getting more refined. And with Gqomwave, Rudeboyz up the ante. It still sports the strong, simple flavors—hypnotic repetition and an ominous darkness that's never allowed to wallow thanks to a martial dance floor punch—that made this South African house variant so appealing. The patterns sound more complex but they are still tightly locked to syncopated groove.
 This is immediately obvious on the standout track, ""Major Turn Up."" Rudeboyz favor explosive drums, which pair well with the monotone staccato chordal strike that wells up in the background. On ""Bounce Back,"" a gqom track that operates in halfstep, the delay on the snares recalls the tip of a drumstick skipping lightly over a stretched skin. ""As'Jableni"" is another banger with the familiar UK funky-style beat that features the vocals of T_D Snaxx, who sadly died earlier this year but leaves behind a legacy of tough township chants. Rudeboyz' gqom has always had motorik drive and funky nous, but a new level of purposeful detail makes it even more exciting.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22004
C.P. Smith - DJ Tools. Vol 1: 808 Tracks,Central Processing Unit,CPU00110110,Electro,December 2017,Post a comment,3.8,"Lately, Central Processing Unit has been moving in an unexpected direction: straight for the dance floor. Sure, the label's mystical mix of IDM and electro was always danceable, but then CPU remade some old bleep tracks and now founder Chris Smith has taken it upon himself to rebuild the skeletons of four classic 808 tunes. It's the first in a new series of releases ""cut loud and ready for battle,"" in the label's words.  This one is strictly for the DJs. You literally don't get anything other than beats. But boy, do they sound good, and 808 fetishists will love the clear and unfettered tones here. There are classic patterns from tracks like Mantronix's ""Needle To The Groove"" and Man Parrish's ""Hip Hop, Be Bop (Don't Stop),"" which means you can play out some of the most infectious parts of rinsed-out classics without actually playing them. Best of all is the B2, cut from Cybotron's ""Clear,"" whose drum track sounds like reinforced steel compared to the original. It rounds off a niche release that should find a dedicated set of fans, not unlike the rest of CPU's discography.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21918
Further Reductions - Disparate Elements,Knekelhuis,KH011,Techno,December 2017,2,4.2,"Talking earlier this year to Max Pearl, Shawn O'Sullivan described techno as ""super flexible,"" and ""more of a blank slate than almost any other kind of popular music genre."" His work with Katie O'Sullivan as Further Reductions is a prime example. On their superb 2014 album, Woodwork, it was possible to hear echoes of mid-'80s dark wave—especially the storm-cloud panoramas of Cocteau Twins and Dead Can Dance—on its viscous dub techno tracks. Disparate Elements, their first release since then, draws more from club music, but, as with Woodwork, these influences redraw techno in refreshingly offbeat ways.
 ""Disparate Elements""'s dancehall snares and vocoder parts might remind you of Errorsmith's Superlative Fatigue. Like so much of that album, ""Disparate Elements"" easily balances experimentation and fun. You could say the same for ""Aural Equivalent,"" whose helium-pitched vocal (""listen to that"") repeats over acid churns and trumpet-like echos. The mood elsewhere is ominous, but the quality remains exceptionally high. You might imagine the opening minutes of ""Central System"" slotting nicely into a DJ Stingray set—the toxic-hued synths and pads that arrive later would make it one of the standout tracks. ""It's Later Than You Think"" is as close as Disparate Elements comes to regular techno, but Katie O'Sullivan's drowsy vocals add yet another compelling twist.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21925
Kuzma Palkin - Macho Culture,Quartet Series,QSB003,House,December 2017,Post a comment,4.0,"Quartet Series is a label with a sharp conceptual focus. Each year it puts out four records with a single theme, the releases united in imagery rather than sound. The Dutch label is in the midst of its second series, which is focused around bodybuilders, with track titles to match. The same model posed for all four covers, and each record is split into a ""dick side"" and a ""butt side."" But you don't need to know any of that to appreciate Macho Culture by Kuzma Palkin, whose brand of house is eccentric enough to make an impression.
 The Russian producer, who has a raft of aliases, has previously appeared as Kuzma Palkin on the oddball Moscow label Gost Zvuk. Macho Culture is Palkin's most straightforward dance floor release yet, but it's still peculiar. Take the title track: it's undeniably banging, but it could make you scratch your head. The hi-hats are sharp but random, though the bassline is so catchy that it doesn't matter what's going on around it. Pairing a throaty low-end with intricate percussion, it could be what a Bristol producer Lurka or Batu would sound like if they ended up on Perlon.
 Minimal house is an obvious influence on the EP. The clacking snares of ""Krepkiye Bitsepsy"" are a dead ringer for Binh's recent tracks, while even the Chicago house saunter of ""Proper Sauna Chill"" features dizzy drum patterns. Palkin's work is never what it seems on the surface. ""Muscle Mass Increase,"" a stripped-back track with the EP's most persistent bassline, is eventually swallowed up by velveteen synths that would make an ambient producer blush, just one pleasantly surprising moment on an EP packed with them.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21922
Nereid - Volume One,Warped Core,WARPED001,Techno,December 2017,Post a comment,3.8,"Nereid is a new project on a new label from a prolific producer who doesn't specialize in techno but turns out to be pretty good at it. After a little detective work, the astral associations—Nereid is a moon of Neptune—suggest it shouldn't be hard to figure out who's behind it. Volume One is an EP of deep and linear techno that will appeal to followers of labels like Northern Electronics, Field and Semantica.
 What it might lack in personality, ""Umea"" makes up for with a shrewd sense of dynamics. It only has a single chord yet it feels catchy. Made up of just a few elements, it savours every bit of resonance and reverb. Sounding a bit like vintage Peter Van Hoesen, ""Operator"" rides a similar one-note bassline into the ground, with some great filter and modulation work, while ""Neptune"" is slightly busier, with a skip in its step and some clever panning. Those details don't seem like much at first, but they'd be perfect for a techno set that's heating up.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21921
Oscar Mulero ‎- Contents Pattern Series 4 Remixes Part II,Warm Up,WU050B,"Techno, Experimental",December 2017,4,3.6,"For the last few years of his long career, the Spanish producer Oscar Mulero's Pattern Series has showcased what's been called ""abstract pieces of modern techno."" The last of these EPs, last year's Colours, has been reworked in a two-part remix package to commemorate 50 releases on Mulero's label, Warm Up. A remix of ""Texture"" by Shlømo, slightly sped up from the original, leads Part II. The thundering percussion doesn't let up, with a haze of atmospherics and the odd distant whirr making the remix more urgent. The ever-consistent Donato Dozzy brings a tinge of acid to his hypnotic remix of ""Colour,"" as droning synths fade back and forth.
 These tracks are functional and energetic, but it's the mind-melting Chevel remix of ""Form"" that really surprises. Twisting and turning through haze and noise, its unpredictability is addictive, with only trickles of a kick drum until its sublime conclusion. Capping off a four-minute track, it's a shame those final moments end so abruptly.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21923
DJ Nnamreg - 612,Melliflow,MFLO8,"Minimal, House, Techno",November 2017,1,3.9,"Vera and Alexandra's Melliflow label has become a hub for hypnotic minimal techno and electro over the past two years. Its output is balanced between formative records from newer producers, such as And.rea, and music from more prolific artists, like Spacetravel. To close out 2017, Melliflow has an EP from DJ Nnamreg. The name might not seem familiar, but it's actually Binh's first name reversed, which makes this his first solo music released under a different alias.  Binh has a skill for injecting freakiness into a frame of air-tight percussion. ""Probably Too Far"" follows a similar pattern to the creepy synth grooves that slithered through ""Booari"" on 2016's Ship Of Imagination double-pack. The other two tracks explore Binh's sound with tools he utilises less often. A pumping kick drum sets the scene for ""Still On""'s uplifting 303 pulses. It builds into an acid techno roller, creating a less eerie and tense atmosphere than Binh usually channels. ""612"" delves into darker reaches, with a thick, sinister 303. As it drags you into a minimal acid wormhole, hi-hats gently tick, further easing you in.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21926
SFV Acid - 818 Extracts,BAKK,BAKK011,"House, Funk",December 2017,1,3.9,"Given he named himself after the San Fernando Valley where he grew up, you could say SFV Acid is invested in his surroundings. Many of his releases are concerned with suburban life (one was even recorded in a Starbucks). 818 Extracts—excerpts from a longer tape released a few years ago—also references the region of Los Angeles: 818 is the telephone area code that covers most of the SFV.
 If you haven't been to the San Fernando Valley, imagine everything you already associate with LA—but on steroids. Sprawling, flat and hot, the horizon never seems to end, and everywhere you look there's another low-rise block and another strip mall. It's an alienating yet oddly dreamy place, two qualities that come through in SFV Acid's work, including ""Lil Gurn,"" a groovy house track with odd chords that whoosh and widen like shadows passing overhead. For a producer whose work is often defined by its strangeness, ""Flies (Candoga Digital Mix)"" is remarkably straightforward, another precocious house track with squiggly synths and a roving acid bassline.  818 Extracts' shortest track lingers the longest. ""Wheat"" is a breezy mélange of LA tropes, from the low-slung Dâm-Funk rhythm to the whining G-funk lead, finished off with—what else?—a splash of 303. Packing a lot into two minutes without sounding dense, it feels like cruising down Ventura Boulevard, seeing almost nothing of note but still enjoying the ride.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21883
Djebali - Album Reworks Vol. 1,( djebali ),DJEBRW00A,"Minimal, House",December 2017,1,3.6,"When the bassline is a good as the one on Arapu's remix of Djebali's ""Heartgroover,"" what more do you need? It's the kind of snaking modular workout he and his fellow Romanians have spent the past few years refining, bobbing and weaving underneath gently shuffling drums and the occasional synth tone. It doesn't have a clear structure but it's rhythmic, doing its thing independently of the developments on top. It's a long way from the chunky basslines of today's house music, so DJs will need a well-tuned soundsystem to capture its subtle flair.  Luckily for those DJs, you should be able to play Andrés' version of ""Seven Blessings"" just about anywhere. A jazzy house tune with cheery chords and hand drums, it's a long way from the heads-down sound of its minimal counterpart and a great alternative to the moodier B-side. But it's still relatively restrained, which means there will likely be plenty of DJs up for playing both tunes. My advice: save Andrés for the daytime.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21924
Anthony Linell - Layers Of Reality,Northern Electronics,NE48,Techno,December 2017,1,3.8,"Layers Of Reality is the third release under Anthony Linell's birth name since shifting away from his Abdulla Rashim alias. After a dungeon synth LP and a heavy techno album, it's the first release that feels like a direct continuation of where he left off as Rashim. Linell drops the atmospherics for the title track and focuses on the mid-range. The chords are springy and textured, with ripples that give the track a curious (and irresistible) sense of momentum.
 Among Northern Electronics' most functional techno bangers, the ice-cold ""Separated From Other Bodies"" offers less in the way of melody and ambiance. That leaves ""The Levels Of Existential Space,"" which sits somewhere between the other two tracks. It starts as another straight-ahead banger but takes an unexpected turn, the lead becoming bubbly as if submerged underwater. The track is then swaddled in a fog of synths that recalls the chilly atmospheres of pivotal Northern Electronics releases.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21920

Label /",N/A,"Experimental, Club",December 2017,2,3.8,"Now in the self-sufficient digital release phase of her long career, AGF, AKA Antye Greie-Ripatti, seems more prolific than ever, having put out at least four releases through Bandcamp this year. And while most of that music falls into an experimental category, Solid sees her dipping back into a more club-friendly style of loops and rhythms. The EP's highlight, ""I-Tikka,"" is a rework of ""MOSQU-ito"" from her recent album, SOLIDCITY. This version splices mosquito buzzes, frenzied chromatic tics, electronic string passes and a solid bassline into a bundle of nervous energy.
 It's difficult to tell if other tracks on the EP also mine the same album, but given the similarity of the releases' titles and the speed in which one followed the other, it's plausible. Each track has loops constructed from what sounds like a concrète jumble of field recordings. But the cyclical structure provides a thread to follow, which makes this EP a more enjoyable—if still challenging—listening experience.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21919
Frak - Lane Escape,Unknown to the Unknown,UTTU080,Techno,November 2017,Post a comment,3.7,"Frak and Unknown To The Unknown have a lot in common. Both go about their business reliably, never following trends or trying to earn cool points. And though Frak are often experimentally minded and Unknown To The Unknown is a clear-cut dance floor label, they both have a sense of humour. As such, Lane Escape feels like a natural development. Frak provide four quirky dance floor cuts that slot right into Unknown To The Unknown's no-bullshit style.
 If you've ever seen Frak play live, hunched over their instruments with their foil hats bobbing up and down, you won't be surprised by the zany funk of ""Lane Escape,"" which sounds a bit like a mangled disco bassline pasted over a Casio preset. The same goes for ""Large Function,"" with a frazzled kick-snare pattern that feels surprisingly hard to follow. And then there's ""Protes,"" where Frak lay down a percussive workout and then throw a blaring synth note on top, an addition that seems like a joke but eventually makes an odd sort of sense. Only ""Long Fork,"" with its electro touches, hints at Frak's darker side.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21910

Benny Rodrigues is the latest producer to utilise this sinister four-word snatch, which is best known for appearing in early Phuture productions. The Dutch producer sticks with convention, pairing it with a nasty 303 for the two originals on his new EP for Unknown To The Unknown's jacking DANCETRAX series.  ""Cocaine Speaking"" and ""Cocaine"" are straight-up jams made for sweaty dancers. The former's relatively chilled intro builds to a mess of tweaking acid lines and drum rolls, peaking during the spangled middle section where the clap lands on every beat. ""Cocaine"" is deeper and more reduced, packing a twangy piano riff that twinkles like the ones in Jeff Mills' catalogue. Alden Tyrell beefs up the bassline on his remix of ""Cocaine Speaking,"" rounding off an EP full of simple pleasures.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22016
Alessandro Adriani - Enter The Fire,Stroboscopic Artefacts,SA031,"Techno, EBM",December 2017,3,3.8,"Techno's coupling with EBM this year reached a peak that could almost be called trendy. But some artists have been touting EBM their entire careers, including Mannequin's Alessandro Adriani. Others, like Lucy, have not. Adriani's signing to Stroboscopic Artefacts feels like a modish move, but like its best records, Enter The Fire is esoteric techno in line with Stroboscopic Artefacts and Lucy's own ideals.
 Like the label he runs, Adriani's productions cut through time and genres, mashing up the old with the new to become ""the music of now,"" as he told me earlier in the year. Enter The Fire captures the Italian at a particularly introspective moment, conveyed most potently on ""Astronomy,"" which utilises airy elements and minutiae details. The grungy EBM version of ""Rituals"" sits at the other end of the scale. It's heavy, dark and will appeal to Adriani's vintage-leaning fans. ""He Who Harnesses The Soul"" nestles somewhere in between as a piece of tough, high-octane techno that makes modern use of a dusty sound pallet. The original ""Rituals"" is a haunted 808 workout that exemplifies why this is such a Stroboscopic record.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21915
"J-Zbel, Low Jack, U-202 - Rends L'argent",Brothers From Different Mothers,BFDM015,"Breakbeat, Techno",December 2017,6,3.9,"Rends L'argent means ""give the money back,"" a phrase that went viral earlier this year following an embezzlement scandal involving François Fillon, the French right-wing politician. The artwork has other sly nods to his downfall—there's the celebratory glass of wine held by Ron Morelli, who contributes a track here as U-202, and a shout-out, in the bottom right-hand corner, to the ""Minister Of Police."" The EP also celebrates the third anniversary of Brothers From Different Mothers, whose tracks—puckish combos of breakbeat, jungle, rave, IDM and techno—have shown a similarly irreverent sense of humour.  BFDM regulars J-Zbel best embody that attitude, and they contribute two tracks, ""Nik Molina"" and ""Selecta (Neuneu Anthem #5)."" Both promise explosive surges but, unlike past material, they sometimes resist the urge to let go. Gated vocal synths carry ""Nik Molina""'s early momentum, with soft acid bubbles and simple hi-hat patterns that add shape. You expect the chunky mid-tempo breakbeats to burst forward, but they instead withdraw at each breakdown. The more insistent ""Selecta (Neuneu Anthem #5)"" shows J-Zbel's knack for bringing together slapstick and solemnity. The vocals (""selecta!""), the cowbells, the ad-libbed arps and the rewinds are a laugh; the sunrise pads and synths that arrive later are sheer bliss.
 The transcendent mood turns sour on the B-side. Low Jack's ""Ice Formula Riddim"" has a low-key psychedelic feel, in which muggy guitar reverb hangs over a brisk dancehall drum pattern. Its stillest moments, where ghosts of dub seem to lurk, are a stoner's delight. ""Whistler (Edit X),"" by Morelli's noise techno alias, is uncompromising even for him. Its distorted howls, faulty engine revs and sparks are ugly yet absorbing. Here, you might imagine Morelli raising a middle finger rather than a toast.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21844
Amelie Lens - Stay With Me EP,Second State,SNDST038,Techno,December 2017,35,4.0,"This year Amelie Lens broke out of Belgium and onto the world stage. She's had huge exposure through performing at festivals like Awakenings and Tomorrowland, and spent the year touring Europe, Asia and Australia. She's also cemented her popularity at home with extended sets and all-night takeovers at venues like Ampere and ​Labyrinth Club. Her skyward DJ trajectory has been fuelled by a series of shrewdly made and highly consumable releases, starting with Exhale in early 2016 and gaining momentum from there with follow-ups on Pan-Pot's, Adam Beyer's and Pig & Dan's respective labels.  Lens has a sound: dark, smouldering, groovy and stamped with femme fatale vocal hooks. She might have overplayed the latter, but as a calling card it's worked to her advantage—you'll know a Lens track when you hear one. Acid is another weapon in her arsenal, which she wields with great effect. It's techno made for tripping out the big room, a style Lens consolidates on Stay With Me, her third EP for Second State.  The vocals are little corny on ""Follow,"" but Lens makes it work by submerging the tough kicks and giving the rest a druggy Plastikman-style makeover. ""Stay With Me"" is also deep and acidic, but more straightforward. On his remix, Perc strips away the acid and beefs up its core. Lens finishes with a banging drum tool, leaving the big room to explore more experimental routes.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21914
Divine Interface ‎- Precious Cargo,CGI Records,CGI018,House,December 2017,4,4.0,"Last year, a small cadre of Atlanta producers hosted a Boiler Room. Divine Interface, real name Drew Briggs, acted as the DJ for Fit Of Body and played a short set to warm up the crowd. It revealed much about the weird, wonderful Atlanta scene. In Briggs' hands, ghetto-leaning house and electro feel like massive rap bangers. When he dropped Suicideyear's electro mix of Travis Porter, the room exploded. Briggs excellent five-track debut for the Atlanta label CGI Records wades through a similar gumbo of influences.
 The meat of the EP is three lo-fi dance floor tracks shot through with hip-hop attitude. On ""Designer Desire,"" Briggs sings the praises of a woman with expensive tastes over a breakbeat track adorned with icy ambience. The title cut is a jacking ode to living young and reckless, Briggs deadpanning, ""If we get pulled over, we get indicted."" The hangover track, ""Precious Cargo,"" digs through the emotional baggage of casual sex. Its auto-tuned chorus, ""I don't mind you using me, as long as you find some use in me,"" could have been sung by Travis Scott or Lil Peep. The G-funk-inflected ""On My Way"" features the singsongy vocals of Clair Clair of the duo Coco & Clair Clair, a group that can be described as experimental hip-house. Divide It is another refreshing document from a tight-knit scene that's concerned with partying and experimentation rather than genre orthodoxy.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21881
Stenny - Old Bad Habits,Ilian Tape,IT036,Techno,November 2017,4,3.8,"There's something about Ilian Tape's style of techno that just works. Artists on the Munich label know how to make techno that goes beyond functionality, which has something to do with the blend of melody, broken beats and robust mixdowns. Stenny is one of Ilian Tape's top artists in this regard, and turns towards a rawer techno sound on his latest EP. It retains the attention to detail that marks his best work.  ""3KK-CB SAT"" is the best track. It lunges through each bar, as Stenny piles on layers of percussion and works in snatches of breaks. The other head-turner is ""Corrupt 506"" with its thrusting bassline and white-hot snares. ""Fortress,"" while less novel, is straight-ahead techno with a pillowy breakdown. Every element fulfils its potential, the track as sturdy as, well, a fortress. Pulling in ideas new and old, it's these kinds of deft moves that make Old Bad Habits an exemplary Ilian Tape release.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21878
James Ferraro - Troll,"<li>
<div>
Label /",N/A,Experimental,November 2017,1,4.0,"It's fitting that James Ferraro's new EP is called Troll. He's often accused of being one, especially in 2011 with his divisive, vaporwave-pioneering album Far Side Virtual. Since then, Ferraro has been restlessly creative, releasing unpredictable music, often under a pseudonym to little fanfare. While Ferraro can be slippery, he regularly returns to themes of sonic futurism, which is the overriding atmosphere of Troll.
 This is best heard in the synthetic vocals, which appear on three of the tracks and sound like they come from the same Vocaloid. I can't make out many of the words but they sound like they're in English, adding an extra layer of meaning to titles such as ""Hedonic Prison"" and ""Cyber Bile."" The equally synthetic sound palette gives the EP a digital sheen, and you'll find glassy chimes and fluted synths throughout. Vaguely Asiatic in its use of pentatonic scale, this meld of styles makes for dense, complex and unusual melodicism that's fascinating and oddly tuneful.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21882
KDA - Hate Me feat. Patrick Cash,BMG,N/A,House,December 2017,Post a comment,3.5,"We've heard about YouTube's influence on breakout artists, but what about Spotify's? According to stats on the Swedish streaming service, the London-based producer KDA boasts over 400,000 listeners each month, which explains why his tracks—which include a number one UK single—have received tens of millions of plays, partly thanks to high-traffic playlists. Where most artists within our scene generate a following through club dates and getting played by big-name DJs, acts like KDA do so through Spotify, YouTube and radio. And given he has less than 7,000 followers on Facebook, you might be surprised to know that far more people are listening to KDA than, say, Tale Of Us.
 ""Hate Me,"" KDA's latest single, sees him bridge the gap between the online world and clubland. DJs like Seth Troxler and Eats Everything have spun it for the past few months, and it's easy to see why. Relatively deep for the high-energy crowds they play to, it has an earworm bassline that zings as it pitches up and down between a basic drum pattern. The spoken vocal—referencing, among other things, homophobia, racism and the speaker's anger towards ""tourists on Oxford Street""—is well meaning but tacky, and it doesn't detract from an otherwise catchy tune. As far as chart-topping house goes, ""Hate Me"" is at the classy end.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21972
Gez Varley & Mike Humphries - Smart Dust,Hard Electronic,HE34,Techno,November 2017,1,3.4,"The gap between hardcore and techno is closing. Some artists have a foot in both worlds but keep them separate, while others are happy migrating between the two. Lenny Dee's Hard Electronic label, a techno offshoot from its older hardcore parent, Industrial Strength, is one of the few places dedicated to the overlap. It's where hardcore acts (Tymon, Innovative, Stormtrooper) from Industrial Strength's roster sidestep into techno, while underground techno veterans dabble in harder or more experimental sounds. The name Hard Electronic is fittingly ambiguous: the label's sound ranges from the brutal industrial techno of Tymon's To The Wire EP to more 4/4-friendly cuts like D.A.V.E. The Drummer and Lenny Dee's collaboration. Smart Dust sees two venerable techno artists pair up for Hard Electronic's most experimental record yet.
 You may know Gez Varley from LFO and for his sleek minimal productions as G-Man. Mike Humphries has also been producing a more slamming style of techno since the early '90s, as heard on his label, Mastertraxx. Varley and Humphries might seem like an unlikely match, but their EP hits a tough and trippy sweet spot, especially on ""25 Years."" Full of rubbery sound design, it boings about on sprung surfaces for an eight minute-long romp that could be even longer. ""Gladiators"" is more boisterous but no less fun. It's the sound of all that pent-up energy letting rip, with an added carnivalesque melody line. With a bold breakdown, ""Smart Dust"" is the toughest of the lot. It's a marmite move that you'll either love or hate. This isn't Hard Electronic's best release, but it's one of the weirdest.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21877
Pender Street Steppers - Pender Street Steppers,Mood Hut,MH019,"House, Dub",November 2017,6,3.9,"Thanks to their whimsical DJ sets, the Pender Street Steppers have become ambassadors for Vancouver's house scene despite only releasing a handful of records (plus the Life In The Zone tape that most of them were sourced from). They haven't released anything in the last two years, so their self-titled EP hits like a storm after a drought, showcasing everything Liam Butler and Jack Jutson have to offer with five reassuring slow jams.  ""Raining Again"" (almost a clichéd title for a Mood Hut track at this point) has all the goodies we've come to expect from Pender Street Steppers. There's a boogie bassline, pitter-patter drums and a sunny guitar that recalls the swampy Disco Mantras album. ""Molto Bene,"" a fan favourite that's been floating around for a while, has a carefree whistling lead and a rhythm section that sounds like it's out for an afternoon stroll.  Two of the tracks, ""Blackboard"" and ""No Need,"" hint at the duo's origins in the Vancouver indie rock band No Gold. The former's brash lashes of post-punk guitar and gremlin vocal sample are especially silly, albeit funky. That leaves ""Mirror (Dub),"" a tasty morsel that explores the dub influence that runs through the Steppers' sound in a new way. Drums echo and wah-wah melodies sneak in and out while chords hang thick in the air, a transition from house to skank that feels as comfortable as everything else Jutson and Butler do.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21875
Tom Ellis - The Colour Red,Minibar,MINIBAR045,House,December 2017,4,3.7,"Having released six albums and dozens of 12-inches since 2004, Tom Ellis has approached his favoured heads-down style from just about every angle you could think of. The Freerotation resident hasn't yet run out of ideas, though. Rather than succumbing to the dead hand of formula, the better of his recent tracks remain playful and inquisitive, exploring and inventing within snug aesthetic constraints. Eight such tracks feature on this new double EP for Minibar, which is a decent trip through his latter-day style: deeper-than-deep deep house, variously zonked and jazzy and shaded with live instrumentation.
 The Colour Red eases in slowly—why rush when the thing's 55 minutes long? ""Divide In Two,"" a furtive dance of lifelike drumming and tremolo'd keys, twists spryly out of your grasp, while ""Virgo"" is a straighter house hypnotiser sunk in gooey filtered pads. Both are pleasant but not so memorable. It takes ""We All Had Legs,"" with its louche chords, to really catch the ear. These sorts of chords, deft and live-sounding, crown several of the tracks.
 They're wistful on ""Won't Be Long,"" a steamier accumulation of shakers, cymbals and distant birdcall. At the release's tail-end the chords provide a sort of pay-off: first on the sweet ""By The Rhythms,"" where Rhodes-like keys get a whistling accompaniment, and then on the far-out title track, which loses itself in a pleasant modal swirl. In between are some (even) subtler treats. ""Not Any More"" is a deep house bubble bath, smooth and gurgling and shot through with longing. And the throbbing ""Shufflers"" places Ellis's percussion front and centre. You might come to these tracks for their delicacy, but you'll stay for their sly groove.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21876
Parris - 2 Vultures,The Trilogy Tapes,TTT064,"Dub, Experimental",December 2017,11,4.0,"Parris was born and raised in London and now lives between there and Bristol. He was once affiliated with Tempa, the pioneering dubstep label where he worked and with whom he released his first EP, a collaboration with Wen. But his sound feels more like dub than a stepper's stomp. 2 Vultures subtly explores the interplay between two moods, where underlying tension is magnified by a sense of calm restraint. It's in ""Hot-Blooded""'s insistent rhythm and low-pitched siren drone, and bubbles in the elastic bassline and sparse percussion of ""Lionel's Dub.""  Gentleness is foregrounded in the soft keys and tumbling melody of the title track—a collaboration with O$VMV$M—and the lazy organic groove of ""Hanging With The Birds."" Parris uses sounds—bird calls, running water, a video game bleep—that could be clichés, but in his hands they feel refreshing. He also has a knack for structure, his music feeling carefully constructed yet unhurried, like Actress at his best.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21873
Lurka - Stush / Wrapped Up,Hotline Recordings,HOTLINE015,"Dub, Experimental",November 2017,2,3.7,"A few months ago, a friend from London tried to tell me what ""stush"" meant. Once he began to explain, I took it to mean someone being unfriendly, but apparently that didn't quite nail it. I get a similar feeling trying to describe Lurka's music, which has its own local, hard-to-define character. The Bristolian emerged as a dubstep producer in the early '10s, but has since developed—through key releases on Hotline Recordings and Black Acre—a flexible and inventive UK techno sound. Some tracks, like ""Choke,"" have the airy sparseness of grime; others have a bright digital sheen that echoes dancehall.  On Stush / Wrapped Up, the grime influence comes to the fore. ""Stush"" is mostly about the low-end, where a womp-womp bassline weaves around tricky syncopations. It's a minimal, no-fuss roller, the kind that might make the most impact as a two-minute clip on some helter-skelter mix with lots of tracks. ""Wrapped Up""'s acid bassline has various sounds thrown at it. There are shrill synth flares, one-shots that fall like soldering sparks and bleeps that suggest an overheating circuit board. As the chime melodies waft in the breakdown, the track, for a few lovely moments, lets its guard down.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21872
Various - WS002,Well Street Records,WSR002,Techno,November 2017,2,4.0,"Dance music changes constantly, but it tends to do so by increments. Real surprises—like, say, a whole collective of producers emerging out of the blue, making smart music with an original twist—are rare. So rare, in fact, that when it does happen it's reasonable to be suspicious. The involvement of the established producer Fold in London's otherwise anonymous Well Street crew suggests that there might be other familiar names behind those aliases. Either way, the label's sound, outlined on a record from Loop LF and this followup EP, is impressively mature, a neat navigation between Livity Sound and slicker deep techno that focusses on syncopated groove and a subtle heads-down mood.  The sound has both club-tool and comedown-mind-melt potential. Loop LF's Stepping Back favoured the latter, but the A-side of this compilation makes more strident moves. Label cofounder Glas Rm eases into the dance with ""Fully Dipped,"" whose loping halftime groove and clipped patois pick up sunlit dub chords as they go. The track's core idea is solid, but it's crowned by the details—especially moments where the master channel chokes on compression—punctuating the flow with duck-outs and dramatic pauses. Fellow label boss Speak7 ups the ante on ""Lohan Hands,"" coming off like Forest Drive West in trippy tribal techno mode. The drums are stern, the low-end sturdy, and the atmosphere erupts in dramatic plumes that might be the ghosts of voices or the shriek of straining metal.
 Loop LF brings things down on the B side, loosening that stiffer syncopation into a more fluid slouch and adding teasing percussion layers to heighten the nudge and sway. As with all of these tracks, ""Drive 22"" takes its time. Demure chord stabs don't enter until several minutes in, before opening into echoey dub space. Closing the EP, a mystery artist (as if the others were known) steers us back into the woozy afterhours zone, submerging elliptical drums in hiss, hum and ultra-deep chords.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21791
Ryan James Ford - Alist Flirc,Marcel Dettmann Records,MDR023,Techno,November 2017,4,3.8,"For anyone curious about what a 2017 Marcel Dettmann and Shed collaboration would sound like, Ryan James Ford is a good place to start. The Berlin-based Canadian channels both of these producers in his hazy techno productions, which on Alist Flirc explore slinky 4/4 and booming broken beats. It's also a style perfected by the Munich-based Ilian Tape label, another likely influence on Ford. Take ""F5th3 Zult1"" and its blunt kick drum, which stutters around the grid in jagged patterns. It's soon joined by soft chords, adding a sense of melancholy to an otherwise booming track. Eventually a playful melody emerges from the haze, a flash of beauty in a bleak landscape.  ""Samenko Wardrobe,"" tucked away on the B2, is the most original track. It has the EP's only straight drum pattern, anchored by another blunt kick. A nimble melody dances atop the percussion, which builds from a dull pulse to a tangle of high-end sounds. The energy rises and falls, refocussing the attention on different elements—the ethereal melody, the bubbling bassline—each time. It'll take a smart techno DJ—like the one running this label—to get the most out of its subtle charm. ""Alist Flirc"" and ""Pegl Shant"" are heavier broken-beat options with tough drums and yawning synths. In Ford's hands, it's a great formula.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21870
Sleep D & Albrecht La'Brooy - After The Rain,Analogue Attic Recordings,AAR011,House,December 2017,1,3.6,"Sleep D, the production duo who run Butter Sessions, keep things local. They nurture Australian talent, helping to establish Melbourne as an independent scene rather than a stepping stone for local producers on the way to Europe. Their recent collaborations have also stayed close to home, recording two EPs this year with Albrecht La'Brooy, the duo behind the local label Analogue Attic. The four producers share a taste for expansive live sets and dense atmospherics, and their styles fuse on this polished release from a scene hitting its prime.
 Albrecht La'Brooy bring a soft-focus ambience to the productions, with synths that swell and drifting piano figures from the DJ Sprinkles playbook on ""Marshland."" Sleep D's signature is heard clearest in the EP's sophisticated rhythms, ranging from gentle hand percussion to elastic electro on ""Limestone"" and the surging kick on ""31 Degrees,"" the only peak club cut. The whole EP is sequenced like a mini-album with a beatless intro and outro, peaking with the wistful melancholy of the title track, where murmured voices are only just audible over the patter of the rain.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21869
Roza Terenzi - The O.G. EP,Good Company (AU),GCR007,"House, Electro",November 2017,2,3.7,"There's a rapport between the underground house scenes in Australia and Canada. You don't have to dig deep to find similarities between, say, Melbourne's Butter Sessions and labels in Montreal's house scene. Both countries are pumping out young producers who make dreamy house music infused with retro sounds and ideas. Roza Terenzi, who's based in Melbourne but comes from Perth, spent a chunk of summer in Vancouver this year, playing gigs around the city's afterhours scene and its growing radio community. She's released her debut EP on the Perth label Good Company, which slots in with the records coming out of Vancouver while putting her own electro stamp on things.  Terenzi has a hard time sitting still: all three of the tracks on The O.G. EP are fidgety. The drums on ""The Right Zone"" and ""Yeh Yeh Yeh,"" which uses the same ""Yeah! Woo!"" break featured in Flørist's ""Marine Drive,"" stutter and skip. You could mix them with old-school electro or deep house. The whistle samples and hand percussion on ""Yeh, Higher Places"" are as common as the ""Yeah! Woo!"" break, but Terenzi's out-there effects puts a different spin on them
 Jayda G solidifies the Vancouver connection, dismantling ""Yeh, Higher Places"" into something unrecognizable. Like her best tracks, it's shambolic and funky, with colliding piano riffs and breathy vocals—it could be a wacked-out dub mix from an obscure disco 12-inch. It's a wacky end to a wacky EP that shows how local scenes can cross oceans.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21729
J.G. Biberkopf - Fountain Of Meaning,Danse Noire,DN010,"Ambient, Experimental",December 2017,1,3.7,"J.G. Biberkopf's debut LP, last year's Ecologies II, tackled ""the way global politics shapes the Earth's ecosystem and the architectures and infrastructures of power."" The music was grand in shape but lacking content. For its followup, the Lithuanian producer narrows the conceptual lens, and his music comes into clearer focus. This EP centres on the image of the fountain. As Biberkopf says, these once had a practical use, as a public source of water, but are now mostly a ""sexualised architectural gesture"" to the glory of ""dominant ideologies."" He links their perpetual ""coming"" to the constant presence of our own cultural history, more accessible than ever thanks to the internet. To illustrate his point, he transforms music from early in the Western classical canon—Catholic masses, pre-medieval music—into a diffuse kind of ambient.
 Biberkopf's ideas resonate with the recent ""neo-classical"" trend, which draws on this shared cultural history, relying on our associations around certain instruments and musical patterns to give insipid music the air of the profound. Biberkop's tracks are similar in some respects. The more angular bits of Ecologies II—drum blasts, jumpcuts, Hollywood foley—are gone, in favour of swatches of celestial voice and the occasional orchestral instrument. But compared to neo-classical's easy catharsis, there's something strange and ambiguous to these five short tracks.
 ""Lake Symphony"" is grand but absent somehow, shuffling furtively through a series of ideas. ""Multiecstasis"" and ""Delirium"" feature more concrete vocal melodies, but their structures are illusory, hinging on strange pauses and confusing shifts of space. For all this, the music is basically attractive, and Biberkopf's mode is inquisitive. His central question is, ""What can be gleaned from this overflow?"" and he seems close to certainty on the Aïsha Devi-featuring ""The Illusion Of Solidity,"" whose kick drum booms and dramatic synth leads echo his past music. The tracks works as punctuation, before things get stranger again on ""Dance Of Relating,"" which stutters and warps before diffusing into mist.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21850
Sasha & Alan Fitzpatrick - El Jefe,We Are The Brave,WATB011,Techno,December 2017,4,3.4,"Sasha and Alan Fitzpatrick might be a headline-grabbing partnership, but does it work? Both artists approach big-room techno and tech house from contrasting perspectives: Sasha's music is soppy and dreamy, where Fitzpatrick's is brawny and straightforward. On El Jefe, their first release together, they negotiate a smart middle ground, presenting two stomping cuts that stir the emotions without going overboard.  El Jefe features two versions of the title track. ""Version 1,"" noisier and more epic, has Sasha's fingerprints all over it, with a wrist-snapping groove charging beneath a blanket of synths that swells and recedes like the tide. The 60-second breakdown, complete with choral wails, should ruffle arena-sized floors. ""Version 2,"" with its giant rave stabs, distant cries and nifty percussion, carries several hallmarks of Fitzpatrick's clean and boisterous style, though the real praise should go to whoever composed the gleaming melody that bursts into life around the midway mark—it's the best thing about the EP.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21858
Hudson Alexander - We're Gonna Have A Party,Bedroomer,3614978698359,House,November 2017,1,3.3,"Toronto's Bedroomer collective operates on the fringes of the city's dance music scene. Hudson Alexander is the group's best-known member, making spirited house music that's somewhere between disco and 2-step, built with melodic samples and dextrous drums. That formula works best on the first two tracks of We're Gonna Have A Party, where fidgety snares and hi-hats do their thing over dusty horn samples. The effect is most pleasing on ""1:19,"" an adventurous cut whose smooth drum patterns and distant horns register like St. Germain's The Tourist meets lo-fi house.  Dusty melodic elements lend We're Gonna Have A Party an of-the-moment veneer, but the rest of the sounds music are too crisp to be lo-fi, sometimes to a fault. Though ""7am"" has nimble drums, it's a little sterile, with only a buried melody offering anything to chew on, while the title tune crumbles under the weight of an overwrought diva sample. The lesser moments on We're Gonna Have A Party are still offset by golden hooks, a sign of Hudson Alexander's talent for tickling the ears.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21855
Roma Zuckerman - That Present Terminal,Trip,TRP018,"Techno, House",December 2017,1,3.7,"When I spoke to Nina Kraviz about her A&Ring last year, she said that she looks for music ""that is almost not done completely, you know? There's like another final step that has to be done to call this song a finished thing. But I don't want it to be finished because my imagination is rich enough to finish it itself."" This might explain why Roma Zuckerman's tracks have found a home on her трип label, appearing on the compilations I Have A Question and Sleep Not Found. The lesser-known Russian's music is extremely pared-back, but a few smart details make it rich with atmosphere and implication. His tracks so far have been druggy accretions of down-pitched voice and sneaky techno funk, and his debut solo EP explores a few other options without losing that unrefined charm.
 ""Years"" cleaves closest to his older tracks, only with a shot of jittery energy—the drums swing hard, the voices are terse and the melody jumpy. ""So What (I Feel Dirty!)"" is even harder, and the obvious lead track, careening along at a Kraviz-approved 140 BPM while a synth lead ties itself in knots. The energy drops on the B-side with ""Your Ego,"" an oddity in Zuckerman's discography. Its sinuous pads are almost soulful, and the steadier clap-kick groove is only occasionally troubled by flickers of half-heard voice. This track comes closest to losing Zuckerman's trademark weird intrigue, which he makes up for on the bizarre ""Robologia (Voice Ring Edit),"" which sounds like a straight-off-the-DAT Chicago jack track with an added slug of 21st-century dread.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21846
Rrose ‎- The Ends Of Weather,EAUX,EAUX991,"Techno, Ambient",December 2017,13,3.9,"There's a depth to Rrose productions rarely heard in modern dance music. Where deep techno labels like Northern Electronics create introspective moods with familiar tones and foggy atmospheres, Rrose does so with force and precision. Like Mike Parker, another top hypnotist, Rrose makes some of the trippiest techno out there, specialising in window-rattling sub-bass and high-definition percussion, all without a whiff of dub chords or melody. The Ends Of Weather is the US artist's first release of 2017, delivering three tracks of wormhole techno and ambient.  Most DJs will reach for the obvious dance floor track, ""Nest Of Queens."" Rightfully given a full side of vinyl, anyone still at a party when it's played should experience the dance floor going into meltdown. It's thick with Rrose's signature sub-bass, which rumbles underneath assorted effects—cricket chimes, pin-prick percussion—that rise and fall in pitch and energy. Propulsive but utterly mind-boggling, ""Nest Of Queens"" is techno at its most psychedelic, the latest in a string of Rrose weapons made for putting late-hour dancers in a daze. ""The Smallest Footprints"" and ""The Ends Of Weather"" are more abstract and won't get much club play, but they're perfect for those fragile mornings spent staring at the ceiling after a night out.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21966
Ténèbre - Territory III,WNCL Recordings,WNCL032,"Techno, Electro",November 2017,5,3.7,"Territory III's path to the record store racks took a few more turns than usual. It was supposed to appear on Ténèbre's own digi label, like all the other music the Seoul-based Frenchman has released under the name. But on hearing the promo, London's West Norwood Cassette Library ""went on a shameless 'beg, borrow or steal' mission."" You can hear why he coveted the EP. Reflecting the oppressive environments of ""the megalopolis,"" Ténèbre's techno can tend towards the grim and grandiose. But every now and then his rhythms flex and swing and the dread-filled moods turn playful. Territory III gives this freaky side a full showing, and its boxy drums and ruffneck attitude brush against the UK raving history often celebrated on WNCL Recordings.
 The link is most explicit on ""Jungle Frontier,"" where slyly funky chords collide with a techno producer's imagining of vintage jungle: breakbeats locked in furtive shuffle, whomping low-end and distant diva wails. It's the EP's standout, and the most striking thing Ténèbre has released. ""Density"" approaches rhythmic confusion from a different angle with one of Ténèbre's favourite tricks: chord stabs are processed into viscous clots of sounds and lobbed into the tracks's electroid workings. The resultant gummy lope recalls pre-modular Blawan. On the B-side Ténèbre's stern moods creep back in, and ""Zone & Interzone,"" in particular, is a bit too warehouse trudge. ""Axe Nord-Sud"" also starts gloomy, its didgeridoo synths and scything electro beat echoing Asusu's ""Sendak."" Then it ditches out into a euphoric, washed-out coda—a welcome surprise, like much of this EP.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21703
Donato Dozzy ‎- Afterhouse Series Volume I,Afterhouse,AFHS01,"House, Techno, Tech House",November 2017,13,3.6,"While Donato Dozzy's techno credentials are well established, his house chops are less recognised. The Italian artist was billed for a house set at this year's Labyrinth festival, and few realise that he is a former resident at Panorama Bar, where he honed the ethereal, rolling style central to his techno sets today. These days he spins tougher beats and his productions land firmly in the techno camp, but every now and then—""Cassandra"" being a recent example—his tracks skew towards house. Dozzy launched the Afterhouse Series to dive into that sound, which Volume I explores with four functional tunes.  Instead of ""Cassandra""'s dreamy melancholy, Volume I gives us analogue sludge. ""D"" and ""E,"" both on the B-side, could have been released on Workshop, with tempos in the low 120s and a melodic bassline on the former that recalls Kassem Mosse's hardware house. The foggy ""B"" and ""C,"" on the A-side, also feel like warm-up tracks. A jagged synth makes the former feel especially twisted, while the more atmospheric ""C"" works with softer tones. Volume I doesn't have the cosmic brilliance we associate with Dozzy, but these tracks would be a great soundtrack to any party's opening hours.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21950
JK Flesh - Exit Stance,Downwards,LINO77,Techno,November 2017,8,4.0,"Justin Broadrick's initial forays into techno have been made of serrated frequencies and stomping kick drums, which is not surprising coming from a pioneer in the worlds of grindcore, industrial music and beyond. But judging from his second EP for Downwards, Broadrick has done his techno homework. Exit Stance is less about bludgeoning dance floors than exploring other aspects of the genre, namely groove and repetition.
 That's particularly true for the title track, which seems to take inspiration from Downwards founder Regis's recently reissued debut album, Gymnastics. Its ruthlessly elastic beat and thin drum sounds trade Broadrick's hellish mid-range for something more wiry. Returning to the rougher textures of past records, ""Motivated By Jealousy"" spurts like an acid track having a fit, while ""Caveman"" sounds like a more refined version of something from Rise Above, complete with a downtrodden synth breakdown. Even these, with their abrasive surfaces, feel more subdued than past records. That leaves ""Bullied By Love,"" a stomper with a lopsided synth lead and a hint of melody. Doubling down on what he does best while stepping into a new arena with confidence, Exit Stance establishes Broadrick as a bonafide techno artist.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21849
Miri Kat - Pur5u17,Establishment,EEST008,Electronica,December 2017,1,3.5,"There have been hints that Miri Kat plays to the ""rave"" half of the algorave equation. A video on her Facebook shows the Iranian-born London resident blasting speedcore during a live coding performance at Berlin's Musik Hackspace. A track on her Soundcloud, meanwhile, has breakcore's hi-velocity silliness. Her debut release proper, for Peter Kirn's Establishment label, is more serious. Brooding and ethereal, its seven tracks occupy a similar world to those of another algoraver, Renick Bell. Only Miri Kat's focus is less on stilted rhythm than on ambience and creeping atmosphere.  This atmosphere accrues across several fronts—each track comes with a video, in which footage is warped and shattered in concert with the music—and it builds carefully as the EP progresses. The opener, ""3m3r63,"" is a hesitant sequence of disconnected ideas, while ""D1574n7"" resembles navel-gazing vintage clicks and cuts, its coddled pads nestled between bell chimes and flickering percussion. The tenderness is short-lived—from there, the sour ""lmm3d1473"" has shades of a fully-adrift Terrence Dixon, and ""6r45p"" stutters and hisses while plucked synth strings let out dark chord cascades. Subtle and oblique, these tracks are difficult to get a grip on. ""7h3f7"" provides a handhold, its wheezing percussion and sunburst melody echoing the big-room electronica of, say, Jon Hopkins. Miri Kat retreats from this peak for the queasy slouch of ""fl33."" And on the closer, ""51r3n,"" a chaotic granular mulch with redemptive undertones, her playful side finally surfaces.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21845
Trance Wax - Trance Wax Three,Trance Wax,TW3,"Techno, Trance",December 2017,16,3.4,"Hearing a track you're deeply familiar with on a dance floor can be thrilling. That thrill might be magnified if it's a guilty pleasure. Therein lies the appeal of Trance Wax, Ejeca's project, which modernises trance classics and adorns them with pounding drums. A few tracks from the project—like Ejeca's version of Mauro Picotto's ""I Feel Love"" on the first 12-inch or Freefall's ""Skydive"" on number two—give me that thrill. The same goes for the A1 on Trance Wax 003, a version of Sasha and Darren Emerson's ""Scorchio."" The original is among the most decadent of late-period prog trance classics, a ten-minute ride through deliriously happy leads. Ejeca isolates the best parts and slaps a pile-driving kick drum underneath—the result is pure pleasure.  But not all Trance Wax edits are created equal. The Future Sound of London's ""Papua New Guinea"" is probably better left untouched, while Joy Kitikonti's ""Joyenergizer"" flies too close to the sun with its screechy elastic synth. It's the kind of track that will make some dancers jump with glee while others flee for the nearest exit, but at least it's gutsy. That leaves Orbital's ""Belfast,"" a melody-rich classic that Ejeca treats with the right balance of reverence and recklessness.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21851
Simo Cell - Pour Le Club!,Livity Sound,LIVITY029,"Bass, Techno",December 2017,3,3.5,"Earlier this year, Simo Cell, AKA Simon Aussell, described Glide, his year-old EP for Livity Sound, as a creative breakthrough. ""I feel free to experiment [with] a lot of different things right now,"" he told Inverted Audio, referring mostly to his music's expanding tempo range. He seemed especially liberated on Glide's ""Obi,"" a 100-BPM creep with glass-shard melodies, and ""Echo Doppler,"" a light-speed roller from this year's Pogdance—both are distinct from the bassy polyrhythmic techno of his mostly UK-based peers.  On ""Feel Di Kouala Vybz,"" from Pour Le Club!, Aussell's scope widens again. It's fast (160 BPM), prickly (thanks to its fast-twitch percussion), and hard to pin down—the doomy sci-fi synths gesture to late '90s drum & bass, but the tuned bass drums and lack of breaks bring a fresh perspective. The ""Intello Mix"" of ""Stop The Killing"" is the other highlight. Of the four tracks here, it sounds most like a high-spec Livity Sound belter, with surgical sound design, counter-intuitive syncopations and icy arps. Other tracks less successfully echo this sound. The bass drones and subtle drum delays make ""How Do U Turn This On"" worthwhile, but the gated wail on the original mix of ""Stop The Killing"" isn't compelling enough to lift an overly familiar drum pattern.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21852
Blind Observatory - Scanning / And The Flying Saucer,Gravitational,GRAL004,Techno,December 2017,2,4.0,"Some of the best deep techno of recent years can be found in Blind Observatory's small discography. Respected but relatively unknown, this Berlin-based producer specialises in a subtle and spacey brand of dance music that unfurls unhurriedly. It's hypnotising stuff, an extension of the cosmic sound pioneered by the Italian label Elettronica Romana and perfected by outlets such as Prologue and M_REC LTD. Scanning / And The Flying Saucer reissues two of Blind Observatory's headiest tunes, originally released on the killer I/Y label in 2013 and 2014.  ""Scanning"" appeared on Moments 001, a compilation that also featured a then-unknown Voiski. A seven-minute trip through bell tones and synth stabs, its tough drums and meaty low-end—particularly when they're beefed up two-thirds though—give it more grunt than most techno in this style. ""And The Flying Saucer"" is more reduced. Another jagged synth splutters atop the kick drum's chug, but there's more space in the mix, putting the focus on those stabs that feel more hypnotic than they should be. DJs played these tunes heavily when they came out, but I imagine no one would complain if they heard them again.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21904
LOFT - Three Settlements Four Ways,Wisdom Teeth,WSDM007,"Techno, Experimental",November 2017,15,4.2,"Debuts don't get more dazzling than LOFT's Turbulent Dynamics. There were raging drum solos (""Yes""), club show-stealers (""Heffalump"") and ambient catharsis (""With Eye Contact""), all delivered with madcap flair. On its follow-up, the Manchester producer takes that writhing snake sack of ideas and squeezes it into a more defined shape. Three Settlements Four Ways continues a dialogue started on the first EP with smart, shapeshifting rhythms and sentimental melody. The conversation plays out across four kinda dance floor epics full of twists, turns and playful detail. The results don't smack you round the chops like Turbulent Dynamics did, but what they lack in shock they make up for in mesmerising drama.  At the EP's open and close, those sentimental synths get the upper hand. ""Filton Recal"" opens with gentle euphoria, its chord sighs and sepia lead-lines lending a redemptive glow to the technoid drums. ""Pottlin"" is even more cuddly at first, but its pensive melodies only hold court for the first minute or so. From there, the drums–soft and crumpled but fiendishly detailed—draw the focus for the level midsection, before regrouping around new, firmer chords.  Structure and deft arrangement elevates LOFT's already strong ideas to the level of brilliance. ""Funemployed"" is the best evidence of his knack for keeping you guessing. The track's percussion patterns don't sit still for a second, forever glitching, bobbing and weaving, letting out squeaks and pops and the odd Bruce-like effects smear. All this nervous energy unfurls during an epic breakdown, before coiling abruptly back into itself like the power cable on a vacuum cleaner. On ""Oh Well, We're All Fucked Now,"" mutant techno is replaced with wilder club shapes befitting of LOFT's former home, The Astral Plane. The dialogue between the bits that make you dance and the bits that bliss you out remains. It's a dialogue at least as old as dance music, giving fascinating new form in LOFT's music.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21790
John Selway / Seltav - Shimmerdown,Future Times,FT045,House,November 2017,6,4.0,"With Rhodes notes and gentle acid licks, John Selway's ""Shimmerdown"" achieves subtle brilliance through repetition. It's gently funky and soulful with hints of techno, the kind of track that will dazzle a party if given enough time to work its magic. That's partly why the 1997 tune, first released as an untitled cut on Selway's CSM label, fetches hefty prices on Discogs. Future Times, the DC-based label that specializes in a mash-up of the past, present and future, has rescued ""Shimmerdown"" from the sharks. It's paired with another vintage Selway cut made in collaboration with Andrea Taverna as Seltav.  Though the buzz surrounds ""Shimmerdown,"" Seltav's ""SPQR"" is the pick of the two. It's from 2000, with the sleek and rigorous skeleton of tech house from that era. A great example of that sound, it features a pacey kick drum, tribal flourishes and an odd bitcrushed synth. It's the kind of steady tune you could imagine at the peak of an after hours, where dancers ride a wave that could go on forever.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21848
Loom - London Ambient,Gobstopper Records,GOB026,"House, Techno, Ambient",November 2017,1,3.7,"Don't let the title fool you: London Ambient is no chill-out record. The title could just as easily be a reference to the background noise of London's club music scene, an ever-mutating blend of techno, house, bass music and grime. Daniel Timms is associated with an abstract grime sound linked to producers like Strict Face or Iglew. He's been spending more time in that scene, launching a party called Acid Fantasy with Akito and TSVI & Wallwork. His third record for Gobstopper centres around ""Saturday Job At Laser Quest."" It's built on a broken beat that sounds old, but the globby bassline is pure UK 2017. Wilfully obnoxious and all the better for it, it's among the more memorable bangers to come out of UK club music this autumn.
 Timms chases other muses on the rest of London Ambient. He touches on stomping house on ""Aacccid"" and raw techno on ""Dog In The Fight,"" both straightforward tunes that get their message across with shoulder-checking drum fills and basslines. That leaves the brooding ""Heavy Glow"" and the feel-good ""Forever,"" semi-ambient tunes with gorgeous flickers of melody. London Ambient is Timms' most varied EP yet, showing that he's been soaking up more than instrumental grime.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21839
Ansome - British Steel,Perc Trax,TPT075,Techno,November 2017,70,2.8,"In case you were wondering, that's Ansome on the cover of his new EP, naked but for gloves, kneepads, shoes and red-tinted sunnies. And the word inscribed on that thing he's holding in front of his groin—a hammer? an axe?—may or may not be ""cunt."" There is presumably some self-deprecation at play in the image, but there's also a pungent, leering masculinity to it. There was a similar feeling to the exposed gent on the cover of a previous Perc Trax EP, 2015's The White Horse.
 That image dovetailed with the world evoked in Ansome's track titles, a grim old Britain of ""Bad Blood"" and ""Stowaway""s and ""Grave Digger Figure""s. Women, when they feature, are prostitutes (""Back Alley Sally"") or fairground attractions (""Bearded Lady""). This fantasy Victoriana isn't meant to be anything but grotesque, of course, but it may make you uneasy nonetheless. This colours the experience of the music. Perhaps all that distortion and shouting isn't particularly subversive, or even joyous, but just boorish macho thrusting? There's no conclusive answer, of course, but you can imagine the post-Perc industrial techno of British Steel appealing to lads wanting to let off steam on a night out.
 The EP's four hyper-distorted stompers thunder relentlessly, each more intense and in-yer-face than the last. Ansome engineers the style well, but doesn't bring much imagination to it. ""British Steel"" is spiced up with a syncopated rhythm, but the 4/4 ""Marching Powder"" is a slog. ""Poison Your Body"" and ""Granite & Mortar"" sound like earlier Powell if his source material weren't angular post-punk but Whitehouse's howling profanity. Feedback and semi-intelligible shouting scythe through the distortion. ""Poison Your Body""'s subtle EBM twist is the EP's only mild surprise.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21840
Jules Venturini - Whities 014,Whities,WHYT014,"Electronic, Ambient",November 2017,7,3.4,"There's a balance essential to much of modern dance music that Whities does particularly well: just the right amount of club, just the right amount of art. Its new one, from Jules Venturini, feels a bit stuck between those poles, but still meets the label's standard of striking music by up-and-coming artists. Based in London following a stint in Berlin, Venturini runs a label called South London Analogue Material, home to exquisitely brutal techno records from inspired newcomers like himself (ABSL, Ansome, Gaja, Keepsakes). Along with two split EPs as Catch, he's put out one 12-inch of his own, a scuzzy left-field club record on the Polish label Brutaż. His second EP keeps that experimental edge, but draws from a warmer, more dreamlike sound.  The centerpiece of Whities 14 is ""Flying Kites,"" an 11-minute kaleidoscope of strings, bleeps and pixelated whispers. It's split in two by a beat that arrives five minutes in, at which point the track becomes a club remix of itself. Personally I like it better before this happens—paired with a kick drum, its glittering arrangement suddenly feels a bit twee, though on the right dance floor it could make for a dazzling moment. The other two tracks, ""Keep Me Close"" and ""Trace Of Smoke,"" are more abstract—hazy floaters with a streak of melancholy, reminiscent of Actress's RIP. Pretty as they are, they don't quite get under your skin. But in their boldness and strength of style, they make Venturini look like an artist capable of great things.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21847
Beaver Sheppard ‎- Tornado Brain (Villalobos Remixes),Sei Es Drum,SED009,"Minimal, House",November 2017,14,4.1,"It sounds like Ricardo Villalobos was in a party mood when he made the A-side of his latest 12-inch: it's among the fastest tunes he's produced. Close to 130 BPM, the ""Villalobos Inretro Baby Rmx"" of Beaver Sheppard's ""Tornado Brain"" hovers in that magic tempo range home to timeless tracks like ""Any Ideas,"" ""Que Belle Epoque"" and ""Heike (Villalobos Mood Mix)."" Years after release, they're some of the Villalobos productions you're most likely to hear in a club. The added pace gives the percussion extra spice, a big reason why this A-side is another bonafide party rocker. It's a shame most house DJs will pitch it down.
 The latest in a long line of Villalobos vocal tracks, the ""Inretro Baby Rmx"" lays a nasally refrain from the little-known Canadian artist Beaver Sheppard over a rhythmic bassline and percussion that steadily builds in intensity. Villalobos has the golden touch when it comes to choosing vocals, so Sheppard's whine—like Jorge Gonzalez's goofy Spanish on 2009's ""Baile""—slots into the percussion, wailing over the leaner passages while taking a back seat during the busier sections.
 The ""Hastenix Und Obenix Rmx"" lands closer to the sludgy sound of Villalobos's only other significant release of 2017, Empirical House. The bassline is muddy and the singing is more ethereal, which creates a heady atmosphere. There's a hint of classic house in the spoken vocal—not heard in the A-side—buried in the mix, which livens the mood when it takes centre stage alongside the sampled guitar in the second half. If the ""Inretro Baby Rmx"" was the happy bomb, this is the drift into space.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21902
Stanislav Tolkachev - There Is Almost No God,Mord,MORDH002,"Techno, Experimental",November 2017,3,3.0,"Stanislav Tolkachev's records often feature an ambient track or two. His best—and the beloved Ukrainian has hit some dizzying heights—ditch his dance tracks' post-Mills funk but keep the wonky, spiralling hypnosis. Or else they go for sonic overload, supplying transcendental moments for spun-out dance floors. There is one track on this non-dance EP for Mord that falls in the latter camp—the opener, ""Eternal Dawn,"" which is as blearily euphoric as the name suggests. From there Tolkachev settles into a scratchy exploratory style, each track a grizzled synth pattern spun into elliptical loops. Where his techno can be effortlessly experimental, these tracks feel self-consciously difficult, and not his best.
 Their success mostly depends on their intensity. ""Perforated Spoon"" thunders nicely through, its oily splats and splutters periodically turning molten. ""Pocket For A Leaky Coin"" is made of similar stuff, though its string of eardrum-scraping ideas follow an odd disjointed logic. ""Landowner"" is the EP's most intriguing could-have-been, its roiling syncopations begging to be transformed into a broken-beat techno monster.
 The energy dips further at the EP's tail-end. ""There Is Almost No God"" and ""Bleed On Me"" feature a single loop—not so much rhythmic as repetitious—drenched in sheets of noise. Both sound static and lifeless, as if Tolkachev left his setup running while making a cup of tea. The seething mulch of ""No One Waves Goodbye,"" meanwhile, sounds like a downtempo track fractured into a million tiny shards. It's nice to hear Tolkachev pull his music apart, but the real trick will be when he puts it back together again.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21843
Ploy - Unruly,Hemlock Recordings,HEK032,"Bass, Techno",November 2017,4,3.5,"When Ploy was putting the finishing touches to his latest EP, Unruly, I'd like to think he named its three tracks with an old (and improbably popular) British ad for wood stain in mind. The appeal to directness in the ad's strapline—""It does exactly what it says on the tin""—is embodied by ""Unruly"" and ""Garys,"" a pair of intense, heads-down dance floor tracks. Same goes for ""Lost Hours,"" a dishevelled thrum meant to evoke the curtains-drawn vibe of an afters.
 Unruly's direct approach is a lot of fun. ""Garys""'s descending Shepard Tones are met by a whistle—it might make you think of ""Drop It Like It's Hot""—sliding the other way. It's brought to a boil by up-pitched tonal layers, which makes for a heady peak-time rush. ""Unruly"" contains a similarly high-pressure atmosphere, though I'm not as convinced by the execution. The lack of space can feel suffocating—the dominant pitter-patter drums sound squashed, and there's not much space left for Ploy's interesting array of one-shots and accents. We decompress with ""Lost Hours,"" a grotty downtempo cut where low-key melodies play over what sounds like snorting.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21900
Domenic Cappello - The Intruder,Nautilus Rising,NR04,"Deep House, Tech House",November 2017,5,3.2,"Domenic Cappello, one half of the legendary Sub Club duo Harri & Domenic, has always been more of a DJ than a producer, but he's had his moments in the studio. Take ""Amber Line,"" a tender tech house cut released under his Hutton Drive alias in 1997. Or URB 'N' RI's gorgeous ""Dream Of A Groove,"" which came out a year earlier on 20:20 Vision. (That one's since become a favourite of Uruguayan tastemaker Nicolas Lutz, who included it in last year's XLR8R podcast.) Cappello's latest effort, a three-track EP called The Intruder, is his first under his own name. Though it glistens in places, it's hard to imagine anyone picking it up in 20 years time.
 Cappello is at his best crafting soft textures and cosy moods, so it's a surprise to find him pursuing a modern tech house sound on the opening title track. It sounds like something you might hear in Ibiza approaching peak-time, all thumping kicks, arpeggiated synths and shadowy four-note motifs. Things mellow out and improve on ""Time To Begin,"" a floaty deep house cut with a brittle drum break that morphs into a gooey rolling groove. ""Rain"" is cut from the same cloth, breezy and pleasant, though this time with an elegant melody that puts a much-needed spring in the EP's step. This is nice music, but it's missing that '90s magic.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21838
S.A.M. - Delaphine 006,Delaphine,DELAPHINE006,"Tech House, Deep House",October 2017,7,4.0,"Samuel André Madsen is a Danish producer with a monk-like devotion to his craft. He works full-time at his studio in Berlin, slowly shaping the sleek and subtle club tracks that are now his trademark, releasing just a few each year on Delaphine, a label dedicated to his own music. His careful effort is clear in his productions, which are near-perfect in terms of both mood and groove, their propulsive rhythms placed within richly imagined atmospheres. Madsen's latest, Delaphine 006, is less of a statement than his last two records—the still unsurpassed Delaphine 007, and his criminally overlooked LP, Dream State Of A Bellmaker. Like all his records, though, it brings a rare level of artistic flair to functional club tracks.  The A1 and the B1 show two key sides of Madsen's sound—one moody and subaquatic, the other bright and crisp, both with velvety textures and irresistibly pumping rhythms. These are glue tracks more than anything else—neither is a climax the way ""Pour Aisha"" was—but they serve this purpose very well. The other two are subtler sketches. A2 is a silky drone that's over in less than two minutes. B2 is the kind of delicate experimentation we heard on Dream State Of A Bellmaker—a fluttering, weightless groove which shows that, while deep house and tech house might be Madsen's main thing, he's not limited to those forms.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21828
Ikonika - Oral Suspension,DBA Dubs,DUB009,"House, Grime",November 2017,2,4.1,"Sara Chen's music has consistently mutated since the post-dubstep days of ""Please"" and ""Idiot,"" her earliest singles for Hyperdub. She's a criminally underrated DJ who breezes through whiplash-inducing tempo or style changes. This is heard in her productions, though they don't always feel geared towards the club—recent albums Distractions and Aerotropolis were more like glittering electronic pop than club music. Effortlessly combining house and grime, ""Oral Suspension,"" on DBA Dubs, is Chen in dance floor mode.
 The swooping stop-start motions of ""Oral Suspension"" recall the early days of Night Slugs, and the way the rhythm moves between half-time and 4/4 makes it a head-turner. It feels soulful and classic yet new and experimental, which reflects Chen's DJ style. Big Strick's remix cages Chen's fluttering chords in a thumping house frame. He keeps its cheeky bounce, a balancing act that feels just as effortless as Chen's.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21836
Jun Kamoda - The Distorted Haunted Ballroom,Black Acre,ACRE072,House,November 2017,3,3.4,"There are a few things that stand out about Jun Kamoda's past life as the leftfield hip-hopper MC Illreme. One is the playfulness of his music. The other is its confrontational quality, as demonstrated by a video from a 2008 in-store, in which Kamoda crouches on the shop counter leading a call-and-reponse over hyperactive surf rock before launching into an unexpected crowdsurf. (You can see Lawrence Le Doux, his bandmate in Baleine 3000, watching quizzically from the side.) He brought these qualities with him when he recently migrated to dance music. His birth-name tracks are weirdo disco house, full of chunky grooves and exuberant samples. But there's a riotous energy to them which you don't always associate with the style, and sometimes this spills over in unexpected ways—most memorably on last year's ""The Clay,"" a riotous percussion bonanza that was hammered by the likes of Pearson Sound.
 Kamoda has yet to reconquer that peak, but he comes close on his second record for Black Acre. ""Body & Soul"" is the track in question, a hard-as-nails drum track punctuated by wailing saxophones. It's compressed as fuck, slamming ride cymbals and diva wails into your eardrums. In the brief break moments where the full drum kit hammers out 16th notes, it's almost too much bear—which is exactly what's good about it. The rest of the record tries for less effective extremes. ""(((BYE)))"" is a low-slung hypnotic looper, while ""Dopey Forests"" is a deep house headtrip, opening with fried psych guitar before settling into a louche groove. Both steadily layer their samples, building to sticky climaxes that detract from their dance floor impact. Kamoda does best when he lunges headfirst.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21826
Beau Wanzer - Issue No. Twenty,Jealous God,JG020RED,"Industrial, EBM",November 2017,2,4.1,"Beau Wanzer has been criticised for releasing tracks that sound unfinished. He's often deemed a descendent of the L.I.E.S. school of hard knocks, but while Ron Morelli's label introduced him to a new audience, he should be considered a free agent. Where his contemporaries look to '80s DIY misfits for inspiration, Wanzer inhabitants the legacy like it's his own skin. It can be hard for newcomers to discern the differences between one scuzzy jam and another, but Wanzer's music has unique substance.
 Refining and sanitising aren't priorities for Wanzer. This isn't music made with a context or listener in mind, which gives Issue No. Twenty a transitory allure. Like bird watching, you might spend a lot of time staring into the trees, but that flash of colour makes the wait worthwhile.
 Wanzer's fluency with machines shows that he's a keen observer of the music that's shaped him. The combination of queasy phasing and pre-delayed reverb on ""Speaker Sisters"" turns a dry drum machine into a churning portal. (It sounds great on 45 RPM, too.) ""In One Ear"" is one of the best tracks he's made. There's just a drum machine, a synth and some effects, but the vibe is twisted, the groove kicking like a toxic goth in knee-high boots. ""He Pushes Meals"" also has the funk, hitting a paranoid sweet spot between post-punk, electro and cold wave. ""Shitty Cough 17"" feels like choking on a truckload of phlegm. Considering Wanzer apparently makes a track a day, it's anyone's guess how many more gems are in his archive.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21886
"Neil Landstrumm - A Death, A Mexican And A Mormon",Central Processing Unit,00110101,"Techno, Bleep",November 2017,Post a comment,3.6,"With its black and white binary code artwork and music that lives on the border of electro and classic IDM, the Sheffield label Central Processing Unit can appear awfully serious. But it's not allergic to fun. This EP from Neil Landstrumm, replete with an oddball title, is an example of CPU's lighter side. The EP is unabashedly retro, highlighting CPU's connection to Sheffield bleep techno, a lineage label founder Chris Smith hinted at earlier this year with painstaking reconstructions of two sought-after bleep tracks.
 On  A Death, A Mexican And A Mormon, Landstrumm uses B-boy samples, zig-zagging basslines and bleepy melodies. His knack for intense detail never feels too fussy. ""Chrome And Ferric"" is so topsy-turvy that it feels random, but there's still care in the wiggling textures. ""Tomorrow People,"" an update on a tune Landstrumm released under the name Navario Sauro in 1996, is so packed with ideas that it could be referencing five eras of dance music. The other two tunes, ""Sahara"" and ""The Chemical Con,"" are less imaginative bleep-inspired exercises.

Trim,Bobby Donny,BODO007,"UK Garage, Bass",November 2017,4,3.8,"2017 has been a busy year for Frits Wentink and his Bobby Donny label, which has hosted releases from Scissorwork, Felix Leifur from Dirt Crew, plus batches of Wentink's own lo-fi hip-hop edits. The seventh EP in the ""wrong house"" series sidesteps into UK garage through anonymous newcomer Low End Activist and Australia's Cassius Select, whose screwy drums are some of the most distinctive around. The tracks are capped off by lyrics from the former Roll Deep member Trim.  Trim is as cocky, witty and embittered as ever. His razored delivery is whetted by Low End Activist's sharp hi-hats and crisp drums in the original 2-step version of ""Park End."" He sounds even tougher on Cassius Select's lurching, bass-heavy remix, showcasing a threatening side never before seen on Bobby Donny—it's good. Frits Wentink lightens the mood with his signature twiddly piano chords, but trap hi-hats and heavy kicks give his rework a mean streak beneath its sunny demeanour. This might be the best Bobby Donny record yet.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21795
Dario Zenker‎ - Trivin Fields,Ilian Tape,IT035,Techno,October 2017,7,3.8,"Two years is a long time in techno. But that doesn't seem to faze Dario Zenker, who runs the Ilian Tape label with his brother Marco. The pair's attention to rhythm and colour has set them apart in an often stern scene, traits that are evident in Dario's new EP, Trivin Fields. The drum-free ""Trivin"" opens the EP with hazy atmospherics and a foreboding bassline that trickles underneath, but it's just an appetiser to ""Koraimer Bro""'s punchy kicks, shuffling percussion and filtered euphoric hooks. As it creeps towards the end after four minutes, you can't help but wish it was longer.
 ""To Feel Sweet"" is the EP's standout. A murky intro bubbles then suddenly shifts into gear with stuttering hi-hats that bring it to life. That spirit doesn't cease in the breakdown as murkiness takes charge like a storm that's been brewing in the background. A kick shuffles, as if to call your attention, before those hi-hats launch into action one more time. ""Der Schlern,"" which features the Ilian Tape artist Philipp Von Bergmann, is a functional electro-tinged number. Warm pads whirr in the background as the bassline moves things along, but by the end you're not that far from when you started. Zenker's productions hit their stride when the focus is on rhythm—it's his trademark, after all.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21837
Conga Square - Secada Mondatta,Palto Flats,PFF01,"Experimental, Downtempo",November 2017,3,4.0,"Palto Flats might be best known for its reissues of Japanese artists like Midori Takada and Mariah, but it's no slouch when it comes to new material. Like those records, Conga Square's Secada Mondatta feels both futuristic and out of time, intelligent yet primitive. It combines electronics, a minimalist and dubby mentality, exuberant solos and a hint of the avant-garde, a recipe that gestures towards the time- and space-collapsing tendencies of the Fourth World. It also inaugurates a new Palto Flats sub-label, PFF, promising ""contemporary electronic/experimental/dance releases.""
 A key trait of the record is the contrast between synthetic and acoustic sounds, like how hand percussion is subtly layered on top of the rhythmic synth line in ""Fifth Season."" The electronic rhythms are pleasingly twisted and funky, teeming with the subtle quirks of an organic system. Unexpectedly, the track steadily becomes joyful as a synth toys with pitch-bent melodic lines and gurgling modulations.
 Similar juxtapositions also drive ""Raiders."" A flute trills suggestively but no one else wants to play—the spacious arrangement is stark, which isolates the frisky flute. The group toys with near-silence and the subs are surprisingly weighty considering the loose atmosphere. ""Raiders"" doesn't have ""Fifth Season""'s weirdo funk, but its restraint makes for a solemn listen. While ""Raiders""' flute and the lead lines from ""Fifth Season"" are essential to the overall character of Conga Square, it's hard to ignore how strong the moodier elements are in isolation.
 Prayers for a more stripped arrangement are answered on the title track. There's steam and moisture in the mix, and the groove, like ""Fifth Season,"" moves in a slo-mo chug in the Salon Des Amateurs vein, producing an earthen quality. The sensation is enhanced by wooden-sounding pitched percussion, which pans above bulbous subs. With these rhythmic and textural chops, Secada Mondatta is a great start for Conga Square and PFF.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21887
Achterbahn D'Amour - Acid Test 13,Acid Test,ASD030,"Acid, Electro, Techno",November 2017,3,4.0,"The German duo Achterbahn D'Amour have always been smart interpreters of the Acid Test brief, taking the mellow new school 303 sound in a range of directions: more techno, more dreamy, more abstract. They've rarely ventured as far as they do on Acid Test 13, their first record in a couple of years. It leaves the house underpinnings of their gentler tracks behind, entering a twilit space where Tin Man-style melancholia gives way to something much stranger. They bring some production tricks with them. If you thought there was nothing left to be discovered in the classic Roland sound palette, check ""Balustrade""'s acid line, a string of weird subterranean burbles and bleeps filtering slowly in and out of focus.
 That track is punishingly slow, but its droning pads glimmer with optimism. ""Dehaveland"" picks up the pace but extinguishes the last wisps of light. What's left is deft greyscale techno, embellished with smears of sour melody. The Dutch electro avant-gardist VC-118A is right at home here—his remix streamlines its loping groove into pinpoint-precise 4/4, and fills its bleak spaces with mirage-like sci-fi soundscaping. We're some distance from Recondite at this point, but the dreamy electro of ""Don't Talk To Me"" makes a partial U-turn, its 303 line turning perkier twirls over cotton wool melodics. It feels like the duo have earned this sentimental moment.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21813
Patrick Topping ‎- Be Sharp Say Nowt,Hot Creations,HOTC104,House,November 2017,28,4.0,"In the world of big-room dance music, you could do worse than look to '90s house for inspiration. ""Be Sharp Say Nowt,"" the monster A-side from Patrick Topping's latest single, blends gospel wails with crowd noises, a fat kick drum and an earworm synth, which combine for one of the biggest bombs of 2017. Topping's ear for classic sounds is well established—he's made music with Green Velvet—but it's never yielded better results than ""Be Sharp Say Nowt.""
 The track's bassline does most of the work, driving the groove during the periods without a kick drum. The energy builds throughout these breakdowns, the intensity of the simple synth riff rising as track progresses. We don't get a clap until three minutes in, so when it finally appears—crisp and precise—it snaps the groove into place. The groove stays steady for the rest of the track, rolling underneath choral vocals and diva wails that slice through the bassline. Don't let the big-room tag fool you—like Floorplan's gospel bangers, this is considered dance music that still hits hard.
 The B-side, ""Track Change,"" is subtler but also well assembled. Vaguely tropical with pumping sub-bass and oddball synths, it's the kind of track Joe, the Hessle Audio producer known for wacky house beats, would make after a night sweating on the Circoloco dance floor. The brain-scrambling breakdown is the sort of thing you'd hear in a Ricardo Villalobos set, and the best moment on an EP that brings much-needed character to the main stage.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21895
mobilegirl - Poise,Staycore,CORE008,"Experimental, Club",November 2017,1,3.5,"The Stockholm-based Staycore crew have established a brand of experimental club music that feels both in keeping with and divergent from the scene around them. Its producers use bright melodies and clear tones, as shown on their lovely Erelitha compilation from last year. The Berlin-based mobilegirl, AKA Bao-Tran Tran, is one of the crew's standout names. She's made a name for herself with tracks for assorted compilations and lighthearted DJ sets. Poise is her first official release, an EP of lilting strings, elegant arrangements and placid drums. It's the most coherent expression of Staycore's sound yet.  The best tracks feel like shiny showrooms for Tran's textures. Synths puff like fragrant bursts of air on ""Yellow,"" while the drums that nudge ""Lone Ripple"" are so well sculpted that they feel more like decorations than rhythm. Tran programs her tracks daintily, with a methodical style that recalls early Nguzunguzu. Tracks like ""Forest Coloss"" and ""Ceremonial Song"" are beautiful and subdued, yet sharp as a tack. The only downside to Tran's style is that when she sticks to the basics, the tracks can blur together. The two tunes that stray from the script—""Scalene,"" with its eerie bird song, and ""Forever,"" with rapid-fire trap percussion—shows the potential of her gracefully off-kilter perspective.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21812
Daniel Ruane & smog - DualExercise_l,oqko,oqko_008,"Techno, Club, Experimental",November 2017,1,4.1,"Disruption in electronic music has taken many forms. The term appeared this month in Michelle Lhooq's feature about the implications of the CDJ. She suggested that CDJs, which allow you to instantly skip anywhere in a track's timeline, have led to a DJ method that's built more on stuttering than seamless continuity.
 There's been a parallel trend in the music itself, driven by artists whose tracks start and stops abruptly. Daniel Ruane and smog squeeze exciting music out of this method on their new split EP, DualExercise_l, which unifies jaw-dropping sound design with impossible rhythms and a generous amount of bass pressure. Disruption is nothing new for electronic music—just look at '90s IDM or breakcore (DJ /rupture even named himself after this aesthetic). But this new wave of producers is distinguished by a taste for high-fidelity textures, an approach that treats sound like sculpture.  Daniel Ruane's track, ""Dissident,"" feels especially cinematic, with drastic shifts in tone that suggest a kind of freeform narrative. The smog remix evens out the irregularities, preserving the cybernetic sound palette while imposing a militant order on the drums. ""Seethe,"" by smog, has the most dance floor potential, with a barrage of overdriven kick drums and a wall of screaming textures. Daniel Ruane puts the track into an algorithmic blender on his remix, and what emerges is a mind-bending lattice of difficult rhythms. The most remarkable thing about this release is the ease with which these young producers navigate two disparate skill sets: impressive, three-dimensional sound design and a genuine sense of musicality.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21809
Buttechno - Super Siziy King,The Trilogy Tapes,TTT063,"Techno, Experimental",November 2017,8,3.9,"Like many experimental musicians, Pavel Milyakov has broad tastes. As he once told INRUSSIA, he listens to ""Japanese noise, 1980s computer music, musique concrète and spoken word poetry."" It's not uncommon to hear dance music artists talk admiringly of esoteric genres, but the curiosity for the avant-garde is often not reflected in what they make. As Buttechno, Milyakov is a notable exception.
 Whatever the styles on Super Siziy King, Milyakov's eccentric touch is usually clear. It's most obviously expressed on the title track, where two surreal vocals—a baritone and a timid whine, like two drunks at last orders—whimper, slur and shout in Russian over a cheeky guitar-picked loop. ""Metallo,"" another strange club track, is a web of scrapyard one-shots with a 4/4 spine. Other tracks resemble the UK club reductions we've seen lately from artists like Bruce and Parris. ""S Dub"" uses delays to stretch guitar strings and knocking sounds over kicks and congas. There's even less to ""K4,"" a skinny shell of syncopations made from instruments you'd find in a kitchen drawer. As DJ tools and rhythm experiments they're compelling, but maybe a little too bare to love.
 Psychedelic splashes of colour make for Super Siziy King's wooziest passages. On the EP's longest track, ""Poleva,"" pop radio clips spin in a carousel of electronic keys and bright glissando. There's an affectionate warmth, too, in ""Mr Heroin""'s reverb-glazed folk guitar and spoken word, but it turns out to be illusory. Scrapes of violin grind the track's narcotic glide to a halt.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21824
Arapu - Wasted Ego,Understand,U007,"Minimal, House, Techno",October 2017,1,3.6,"While professional DJs tend to keep their video gaming habits off social media, I know a few spend their weeknights playing Battlefield and NBA 2K. The unlikely source of the female vocal on ""Wasted,"" the B-side of Arapu's latest single, is an elf on 2003's Warcraft III, one of the world's best-selling PC games. Considering Arapu was in high school when it came out, I'm not sure how often he still plays. But it's easy to hear why this particular vocal caught his attention, climaxing with a statement I'd wager he's heard throughout his career: ""I'm soooo wasted.""
 ""Wasted"" has been a hit on Romanian dance floors for more than a year, so its power is established. The music is simple enough, with a buzzing bassline, a squelchy clap and a hive of synth snippets that squiggle and fizz. As always with top minimal tracks, the breakdowns always seem to end at a perfect moment, notching up with energy each time the blunt kick returns. The vocal—ethereal and weird—does the rest of the work. The other track, ""Virgo Ego,"" is the closest Arapu gets to techno. This time a hyperactive bassline does most of the damage, while another vocal—seemingly male and just as strange—adds colour. Never cheesy and always powerful, the subtle breakdowns are once again sublime.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21885
Goiz - Big Ol' Goiz,Red Ember Records,RERV004,Deep House,November 2017,2,3.6,"For a man who just brought back a decades-old house label, Ewan Jansen, the founder of Red Ember Records, seems impressively un-nostalgic. Around the turn of the millennium, he released a batch of deep house records by himself and Justin Zerbst that have since become holy grails, fetching north of €100 a piece on Discogs until he reissued them this year on Embers Only: Selected tracks 1997 - 1999. And yet, aside from that collection, Red Embers 2.0 has been firmly focused on the future. Following an EP of new music from Jansen, it presented four hitherto unheard producers on Deepsounds Two, a mini-compilation from earlier this year. This month, it released the first EP from another promising new artist, Florida's Goiz.  Red Ember always had clear sources of mystique. It's based in a remote corner of the globe (Perth, Australia) with an original catalog that was preposterously rare, pressed on lathe-cut vinyl in runs of as few as 30 units. But the reason it became a cult favorite is, of course, its sound: a blend of mellow moods and kinetic rhythms that nails the sweet spot so much deep house aims for. Like Deepsounds Two, Big Ol' Goiz is a bit more timid than the classic Red Ember records, but its best moments live up to this lofty standard. ""Tortilla Flat"" and ""Sifting"" pair low-key beats with glowing organs and goofy spoken word bits—a bit vanilla maybe, but undeniably smooth. The other two tracks are where Goiz really shines. ""3MV"" is a soaring cut of electro that maintains the record's daydreamy vibe, even at 132 BPM. ""Fornix"" combines the best elements of the other tracks, with plump bass tones, crafty drops and syncopated drums that keep you bouncing till the end.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21704
Overmono - Arla III,XL Recordings,XL887T,"Techno, Ambient",December 2017,4,3.7,"Overmono has taken a bit of getting used to. Working solo, both Russell brothers can make awesomely characterful, standalone club moments like, say, ""Hackney Parrot"" or ""Kymin Lea."" Their Overmono tracks, by comparison, are level, atmospheric and sometimes sketch-length. They work best in sum rather than individually, which might be why the project's releases have been grouped into a trilogy. Arla II had the puzzle's key pieces (it would be great to hear the duo experiment more with those odd time signatures). The trilogy's final instalment fills the remaining gaps.
 As with the previous EPs, the obvious standout is a rolling techno epic with spuming trance leads. ""Phase Magenta"" isn't the best in the style, but it's a satisfying slice of big-room shock and awe. Elsewhere the duo home in further on Overmono's trademark mood: cresting euphoria expressed via gauzy '90s signifiers. It's exquisite in ""Inulin,"" where junglist breakbeats stutter and whirr through a teary mist of chords. Almost as good is ""Harp Open,"" a two minute hands-in-the-air breakdown without a drop. Only ""Pom"" is a bit lacklustre, slowing the Overmono chug to 90 BPM and turning the mood inwards. Giddy highs are what Overmono do best.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21808
The Bug - Bad / Get Out The Way,Ninja Tune,ZEN12477,"Grime, Bass",November 2017,1,3.6,"It's been ten years since Flowdan, Killa P and The Bug made grimy dancehall history. Originally released on Hyperdub in 2007, ""Skeng"" slayed soundsystems back then, and it still does today. Bad / Get Out The Way is no ""Skeng,"" but it comes close. It follows up last year's collaboration with D Double E and Riko Dan with even more dread, but it doesn't quite live up to the oddball ""Box"" or the catchy ""Iceman.""
 There's a loaded minimalism to Flowdan's flow. Along with his distinctive patois, it resonates with The Bug's sparse, swaggering productions. ""Bad"" isn't their finest collaboration, though. If anything it's too bare-boned from The Bug and not as forceful from Flowdan (compared with, say, ""Dirty"" from Angels & Devils). ""Get Out The Way"" has more fight to it, featuring Killa P and Irah spitting bullets over a chest-baring instrumental that's strewn with shrapnel. It's one of the best war dubs you'll hear all year.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21798
Vatican Shadow / Ancient Methods - Bunkerterror,Hospital Productions,HOS486,"Techno, Industrial",October 2017,3,3.6,"When Dominick Fernow's Vatican Shadow project experiments with techno, its signature horizontal sweep gets crushed into a ball. Fernow excels at telling a story with open spaces, deteriorating textures, allusive samples and controlled tension. That's all there on ""Monotheism And Zarqa,"" but it's linked to techno's tight-cycling circles, which condense and blur the narrative into something more visceral. It trades subtlety for bulk, but the clang of metal and half-heard background details make this more suggestive than your average techno fare. Although his work loses some profundity and originality in this mode, it's instantly recognisable in the context of a techno DJ set.  If Fernow's side feels like choking on plumes of toxic smoke, Ancient Methods' side evokes a forced march. But as always, the pump-action stomp of his rhythms are deceptively funky. Each downbeat in ""Immured In Supreme Beliefs"" is like a boot in the face, but it lunges the dance forward with each repetition. It's oppressive but deliriously fun, so extravagant that it's invigorating.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21686
DJ Lycox - Sonhos & Pesadelos,Principe,P020,Kuduro,November 2017,5,3.7,"As pretty much the only label documenting Lisbon's increasingly important batida and post-kuduro scene, Príncipe's release schedule is the easiest way to stay updated with its development. DJ Lycox isn't exactly a newcomer—you may have seen him DJ at various Príncipe parties internationally over the past couple of years—but Sonhos & Pesadelos is his solo debut. While it's full of enthusiasm for the dance floor—its ten tracks are rhythm compositions of some sort—the range is broader than you might expect.
 Anyone looking for the syncopated rhythms, lazer synths and militant attitude of kuduro should go straight to ""La Java."" (Surely it's no coincidence that there's a Paris nightclub of the same name.) ""Nichako,"" the other standout, underlines Lycox's similarities with gqom, the South African style of house. There's an almost Balearic swing to ""Domingo Abençoado,"" while ""Sky""'s 4/4 and melody of strings could be disco house, until a jumble of extra percussion tumbles in. Angolan genres like kizomba and tarraxinha no doubt inform Lycox's approach. His ear for odd melodies suits his bright palette, which maintains pop intrigue while remaining unconventional, intriguing and occasionally confusing.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21785
Terence Fixmer - Dance Of The Comets,novamute,12NOMU180,Techno,November 2017,Post a comment,4.0,"NovaMute was key during techno's early days, releasing landmark records from the likes of Plastikman, Speedy J and Luke Slater. Returning after nearly a decade earlier this year, it's back with an EP from Terence Fixmer, who's currently in the throes of a renaissance. Besides keeping the EBM flame burning with Nitzer Ebb's Douglas McCarthy, Fixmer's hypnotic techno and trademark sound design has found a home at Ostgut Ton. His second EP for the label landed this summer, another quintessential Berghain record. Dance Of The Comets  is another space-themed techno record, but it's approached in true Fixmer form.
 The title track is for the dance floor. With tough kicks and swirling synth lines, it's turbulent and high-energy—classic Fixmer. The rest of the EP is more adventurous. ""Orion"" is physical, with a relentless buzzing loop that feels like it's drilling into you. Elsewhere sounds are slowly modulated into droopy dips and squelchy peaks, throwing chaos into the regimented rhythms. ""The Silence"" is the most abstract track, where air escapes from vents and whooshing noises gesture towards some kind of lost in space scenario, made all the more dramatic by alarm bells and tense atmospherics.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21797
Pinch - Brain Scan,Aquatic Lab,LAB018,Dubstep,November 2017,2,3.6,"Clever sound design is one of Rob Ellis's many fortes. A balanced application of dread is another, because too much can turn a dubstep tune into a caricature. Space might be the most important ingredient of all, and Pinch's best tracks are cavernous and uncluttered. There's something effortlessly introspective about them as well—you're coaxed inwards, not pulled in by force. Brain Scan puts all of Ellis's trademarks to use.
 ""Abducted"" is the most dread-filled track of the three. It's classic murky dubstep, with rolling sub-bass, cold synths and foggy mists. Samples and pressurised sonic treatments add a narrative layer to this heavy-lidded creeper. An electrified bassline runs through ""Brain Scan,"" which is poked and prodded into action by vibrating details at either end. ""Street Light"" aches with bass and shimmers with iridescence. Pinch's purist sound has become more refined and intoxicating with age.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21796
LSD - Process,Ostgut Ton,OTON109,Techno,November 2017,2,3.6,"Luke Slater, Steve Bicknell and Dave Sumner (AKA Function) came up with the idea of collaborating during a release party for the latter's Berghain 07 mix. The LSD project was originally planned as a one-off performance at Berghain, but it went so well that they decided to take their approach—where each member tweaks a different element of the track—to wax. Process, one of Ostgut Ton's toughest records, is their first release.
 ""Process 1"" packs so much energy into five minutes that it feels like it might explode at any minute. It's the best example of the group's hands-on approach, with boisterous synths that rise and recede around the pounding kick drum. Luke Slater's influence dominates ""Process 2,"" which is exuberant in a different way. His instantly recognizable FM synths feel like a vice grip around your head, an inversion of the outward thrust of ""Process 1."" The third track is a more restrained 11-minute jam. Only the spaced-out breakdown makes an impression, but this is still rock-solid techno.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21789
Cloudface - Super You,Mood Hut,MH018,"House, Ambient",November 2017,2,3.7,"Back in 2013, David Reynolds produced Mood Hut's first 12-inch, Devonian Garden. With its scuffed melodies and ramshackle percussion, it contained the elements that would later define the Vancouver scene. Reynolds' second Mood Hut EP treads the same ground as his first, but given how well those early records have held up, it's a pleasure to have him back.
 If anything, Super You is even more chilled than Devonian Garden. Drums are little more than a light rustle, leaving centre stage for robust bass wiggles and liquid keys. ""W W I"" is particularly winning, its broad bassline and bouncing toms lit by dazzling synth tones. These crystal melodies are smeared atop the gentle ""Baby J"" and left to echo unaccompanied on the beatless sketch ""J P,"" which is tinged with the melancholy of summer's end. Even on more muscular tracks, like ""II,"" there's a meandering quality, which comes from Reynolds' distinctive light touch.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21803
Bocksrucker - SixSixSix EP,Neubau,BAU006,"Post-Punk, Techno",November 2017,1,3.8,"Vienna's Florian Bocksrucker seems to have a thing for the occult. His debut, last year's Tarot EP, featured ravens and a horned skull on the cover. The follow-up, on the insurgent local label Neubau, is called the SixSixSix EP and has a devilish set of track titles to match. That's not all—the EP's three tracks are built around samples from Ken Russell's The Devils, a 1971 film about a 17th-century catholic priest who was executed for witchcraft. Graphic and transgressive, the film was banned in several countries and heavily censored in others (the unedited ""Rape Of Christ"" scene was only rediscovered in the '00s). Bocksrucker uses it to add a pinch of devilish drama to his post-punk techno dirges.
 Take ""Sirius Match,"" in which our priest receives his sentence: ""It is ordered that you be taken to the marketplace, tied to a stake, and burned alive!"" The moment highlights the music's grim inevitability, and the sickly tint of its spine-chilling atmosphere. ""The Devil Has Spoken"" is grislier still, its droning low-end joined by banshee-wail noise and a wisp of ghoulish melody in the breakdown. Both tracks are decently terrifying, but ""Mephisto's Offer"" steals the show. Bocksrucker's usual 4/4 is replaced by syncopated kick drums that bob and weave circa 90 BPM, while dissonant bell tones offer the EP's most memorable splash of melody. In the breakdown, the priest makes a last-ditch appeal: ""I know I am a weak and bad man. But after this journey I may find the strength to change…"" The sound of a leering crowd erupts in a cloud of reverb, before the music resumes its deathly trudge.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21793
Tzusing - In A Moment A Thousand Hits,Bedouin,BDN016,Techno,October 2017,12,4.3,"Tzusing is one of 2017's techno success stories. Earlier this year the Malaysian-Chinese producer released an electrifying album that underlined the agility, force and unpredictability that makes his music stand out. Inspired by a wuxia martial arts novel and full of muttered vocals, exotic instrumentation and militaristic drum patterns, 東方不敗 had the feel of an action movie. Since then he's toured the world more extensively than before, mixing EBM, industrial, hip-hop, pop and experimental club with techno. Tzusing finishes the year with a five-track EP that refines the best parts of his album into a precision attack.  Rather than tying his tracks to a linear beat, Tzusing deploys drums at key moments, avoiding the usual build-up and release model in favour of something more explosive. He recently compared his approach with a motorcyclist zipping between slow cars on a crowded road. The kick drums on tracks like ""Flow State"" and ""風雲再起"" are animated, lunging forward as if chasing after something. Extra samples, like gun shots between the drums on ""Shame,"" make the EP feel more breathless and jumpy.  Tzusing's onslaught isn't just about percussion, as sounds are stretched until they sound threatening. Taiwanese throat singing—a new touch—adds a sinister dimension to his blackened beats. And when he throws in breaks on ""地心引力抓不住你"" and plays with horror movie tropes on ""得意先生,"" even familiar sounds feel exciting. Tzusing has become one of techno's most exciting artists by throwing genre doctrine to the wayside. That giddy irreverence makes In A Moment A Thousand Hits one of the most exhilarating techno records of the year.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21698
Arkajo - Fathomless Music,Aniara Recordings,ANIARA020,House,November 2017,2,3.8,"Whatever's going on at Aniara HQ—is founder Fabian Bruhn hooked on energy drinks?—has made a great label even better. After building its reputation on pads, pianos and haze, the Swedish label has turned to more direct sounds. Ditching smoke machine fog for strobe lights, it spent the past two years putting out dance floor killers from in-house artists Henrik Bergqvist, Arkajo and Genius Of Time. Arkajo (one half of Genius Of Time) returns with Fathomless Music, another set of lean club weapons and Aniara's 20th release. The Aniara haze that cloaks most of its releases also hovers here, but the drums are mean and the basslines are fat, making for three snappy tunes with plenty of flair.
 An acid line makes it into ""Fathomless Music,"" the EP's best track. The hi-hats tick as a 303 comes and goes, eventually joined by a monotone Phuture-style vocal. Perky hand drums dance about the grid, giving an otherwise machine-driven track a tribal touch. ""Tape 7"" and ""Groove Ett"" are deeper, built around driving grooves and heaving low-ends. With its yawning tones and thick atmosphere, there's a hint of the Romanian sound in ""Groove Ett""—until the cymbal and diva vocal come crashing in. Like many releases before it, Fathomless Music reminds us of Aniara's place among modern house music's essential labels. Few manage to remain high quality after ten records, let alone 20.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21862
DJ Spider & Franklin De Costa - F Planet,Berceuse Heroique,BH042,Techno,November 2017,3,3.5,"Dour, muggy and sometimes fucked up, DJ Spider tracks are an acquired taste. It's rare to get a straight banger out of him, and his more abstract tracks are usually the best. Spider has collaborated a lot over the years, and F Planet is his second release with the Berlin-based Franklin De Costa, after the Genetically Modified Tracks series for Killekill. They've taken a more panoramic approach on their Berceuse Heroique debut.
 ""Astral Pilot"" snakes and rattles through an otherworldly tundra of mysterious pan notes, crunchy sounds and mingling chords. The bassline chugs independently of the swirling dream mass above it. ""F Planet"" is more tuned for dance floors, but after two minutes this heady trip succumbs to noisy self-sabotage, turning squeaky and squidgy before shifting into a final downtempo phase. It's a fussy, polarising track. Shifted streamlines things with his version, which is easier to digest but less charismatic than the shapeshifting original.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21794
Djrum - Broken Glass Arch,R&amp;S Records,RS1715,"Ambient, Techno",November 2017,7,3.7,"Some of Djrum's strongest records have come through the label 2nd Drop Records, which hosted his journey from dubstep towards techno and UK garage. He's not the first 2nd Drop Records artist to release on R&S—Tessela made the shift in 2013. Broken Glass Arch, Djrum's first record for the legendary label, sees him find new ways to balance delicacy with toughness. On ""Broken Glass Arch"" echoing claps make way for whacking percussion and rumbling kicks, but a pad emerges just as the tension reaches boiling point.
 Lightly treading melodic elements lend a deeper side to an otherwise functional drum track, ""Showreel Pt2."" It combines lurching percussion and bursts of breaks with twinkling keys and a softly vibrating 808 cowbell. ""Showreel Pt1"" brings the energy down with a beatless excursion that revels in reverbed piano strokes and panting breaths. This is a more fragile and vulnerable side to Djrum than we're used to.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21712
Max Loderbauer - Greyland,Marionette,MARIONETTE06,"Synth, Experimental",November 2017,Post a comment,3.7,"Max Loderbauer, a respected collaborator of the likes of Ricardo Villalobos, Moritz Von Oswald and Tobias Freund, has only released one other solo record, 2013's Transparenz. Given the ensuing gap, you might expect his return to be an avalanche of pent-up ideas. But if anything, the German synthesist has got more tight-lipped with time. Will Lynch identified a ""drab romance"" in the austere synthscapes of Transparenz, matched by the grey cloudscape on its sleeve. This EP's cover, by Marionette's in-house illustrator Jake Fried, features an even darker woodland scene, in which only outlines can be picked out in the dim moonlight. The music matches. We're very much in Greyland, where the colour palette is narrow and the gestures restrained and cautious. The music's scale has reduced from Transparenz's broader kosmische panoramas into a series of up-close miniatures. But it's as rich as ever—you just have to lean in closer.  Most of the EP scuds along on a furtive pulse. On ""Corner"" it's in the synth arps, clambering over each other like spiders while background textures grow to a dull roar. ""Undercurrent""'s dry tones throb and hum to a more neutral tune. And the brighter ""Artus"" is almost playful, its sour metallic tones ping-ponging across a broader drone space. The track develops a subtle shuffle as it goes, which leads nicely into ""Who's That Born,"" the closest thing to a dance track from a producer known for his work with techno legends. Not that you'll be hearing this on too many dance floors: its electro-ish groove is sluggish and smeared, nudging gloomily under the EP's most downcast bit of melody.  In all this grey, two slightly more expressive tracks stand out. ""Heliopolis""'s polysynth tones drift between majesty, sourness and moments of tender optimism, leaving viscous decay trails in their wake. The same reedy sounds return on ""Golden Crescent,"" where after a couple of minutes a rumbling bassline throws their wandering patterns into a redemptive new light. It's a dramatic moment of catharsis, at least by the standards of this humble EP.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21792
Dan Only - Banged Out Funk,New Kanada,NK68,"Techno, House",November 2017,5,3.7,"Canada's strong reputation for house and techno may be partly thanks to harsh winters that keep its producers indoors. The Toronto native Danny Voicu, more recently known as Dan Only, continues the trend with Banged Out Funk on New Kanada. Following ""Pacific Heights,"" an ambient track released on the label in September, Dan moves to a more cavernous sound that blends dense machine-driven techno with the broken bass-influenced sound of New Kanada's past releases.  With its poignant high-end frequencies and uplifting groove, the title track has a crystal shimmer. ""Gut Rot,"" one of the stronger tracks, swirls with an arrangement of a simple yet effective 808 loop, harps, hi-hats and an expert 606 pattern towards the end. The simpler ""Sharp Ones"" has a tumbling swing that recalls Dan's former house alias, Diskotekk. It stays true to the feel of the package with its hazy and crunchy synths, but it doesn't match the rest of the EP's killer attitude. ""Rezervoir"" is the clear dance floor leader. Its growling subs and distorted off-pitch lead synth transports us to the dark depths of Canadian winter. This could be a breakout EP for Dan Only.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21787
DJ Richard - Path Of Ruin,Dial Records,DIAL074,"House, Techno",November 2017,3,3.8,"DJ Richard's brand of house and techno is stark yet glows with emotion. Path Of Ruin is his first release since the 2015 album Grind. Like that record, it looks towards his home on the American eastern seaboard. Inspired by the region's harsh winters, Path Of Ruin is brittle and made for biting air and dark nights. It takes the most memorable aspects of Grind and isolates them, making for a more direct release.  ""Path Of Ruin (Pain Mix)"" could become one of DJ Richard's best-known tracks. Like the best artists on Dial, Richard gleans something compelling from simple sounds—in this case, an ominous chord. The tension stays high for all ten minutes, while melancholic melodies and a crestfallen bassline orbit the centre. Richard plays with multiple clashing melodies on ""Gargoyle""—a sleight of hand that showcases his sharp sense of musicality—and steps away from the dance floor entirely for the bleak ""Stygian Freeze,"" which is just a chord progression flickering over a somber bassline. Silence speaks volumes on ""Stygian Freeze"" and the rest of Path Of Ruin, an EP that sees DJ Richard find his voice by using it sparingly.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21788
Nuel - Replica,Kontra-Musik,KMWL010,Techno,October 2017,1,3.9,"It's good to have Nuel back. After the challenging experimental electronics of 2016's Hyperboreal LP, his first solo record since 2011, the Italian producer returned to deep techno. Recent months have given us a one-two punch of nuanced, wide-ranging EPs: first, Tecnica for Semantica, and now the Replica white label for Kontra-Musik.
 ""Ballet"" is a nocturnal soundscape that's drum-free but propulsive, thanks to its polyrhythmic mixture of ascending synth spirals and restless dubbed-out ambience—textures that we've been hearing more often in Nuel's output since Hyperboreal. ""No Wonder"" and ""The Swan Song"" are straightforward cuts of shimmering atmospheric techno. The former weaves acidic curls into a rustling 4/4 thump, while the latter, with its fleet-footed bounce and vibrant pads, feels weightless. ""Replica"" finds Nuel in heads-down mode—it's the record's only DJ tool—before the zoned-out ambient synth sketch ""Surrender"" ends the release.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21801
Synkro - Hand In Hand,Apollo,AMB1710,Bass,November 2017,1,3.2,"Joe McBride makes dance music with a soft and gooey centre. His Synkro tracks are so wrought with emotion that they can feel over the top, but sometimes he strikes a balance between steely and sentimental. Hand In Hand, a new EP following his underwhelming Changes album, touches on that middle ground. It was apparently influenced by '80s library music, but it keeps the tics that have always defined Synkro.
 The best parts of the EP don't sound like library music as much as the old Autonomic sound. The widescreen synths and '80s basslines of the title track are majestic, and the 85-BPM kick drum that interrupts the misty synth background is especially attractive. ""Automatic Response,"" whose title even seems like a reference to Autonomic, is another highlight, with expressive drums to match the melodies. These two tracks are enough to make anyone who was into Instra:mental and dBridge's work back in 2010 feel a pang of yearning.
 The only tune that bears any resemblance to library music is ""Vanishing Point,"" but with its slightly musty lead and prefab drums, it feels like it's trying too hard. The same goes for ""Red Sky,"" which can't save itself from the high-pitched vocal sample that nudges it into cliché. As ""Automatic Response"" and ""Hand In Hand"" show, McBride emotional songwriting's connects best when he keeps a lid on the melodrama.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21742
Drums Off Chaos - Compass,Nonplace Records,NON43,Experimental,September 2017,Post a comment,3.6,"By the time the ex-Can drummer Jaki Liebezeit died in January he had spent decades developing a distinctive approach to rhythm. Dubbed ""E-T Rhythm"" theory, this approach was ""based on natural principles of movement… observed during his lifelong ethnological research into drumming,"" and followed ""the behaviours of sticks and drums according to natural laws of gravity, distance, acceleration, rebound, and so on."" This is according to the journalist John Payne, who, alongside the producer and Liebezeit collaborator Jono Podmore, is crowdfunding a book on the theory. Payne and Podmore had urged Liebezeit to write the theory down, but ""he always replied he'd do it when he was too old to play the drums."" He was playing right up until he died, so in his absence the pair turned to his collaborators for help.  Among them were Drums Off Chaos, a percussion group that formed around Liebezeit and his ideas in the '80s. For decades the group issued few recordings, so the Compass EP marks a change of tack, offering an introduction to Liebezeit's beguiling rhythmic world. Its utilitarian percussion tracks, each of which explores a single hypnotic idea, work as all-natural partner pieces to the electronic music of Burnt Friedman, another Liebezeit collaborator who releases this EP through his Nonplace label.
 It's tempting to try to seperate these hypnotic grooves into blocks. ""Clockwise Instinct,"" for instance, loops in groups of seven, while ""Nine Out Of Nine"" (unsurprisingly) loops in groups of nine. But Liebezeit disliked the Western musical convention of bars. (According to group member Maf Retter he used to say, ""No music behind bars."") It's better to approach these tracks as flows of polyrhythm with no clear start or ending—a kind of rhythmic infinity pool to float in.
 Aside from resemblances to some non-Western folk music, the results will chime with producers obsessed with their Euclidean Rhythm generators. This isn't stuff you could do with a computer, though—often the richness of acoustic timbre is the main attraction. On the jaunty ""Antidote,"" bells and tom-toms deliver a bright cascade of semi-melody. ""On Circles"" indulges in jangling hi-end and smoky cymbal hits, while ""Turn Off The Blue"" is an ambient cool-off that swaps rhythm for rustling stasis.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21694
Magna Pia - ARCS-05,Arcing Seas,ARCS05,Techno,October 2017,3,3.6,"Cassegrain make functional techno with an experimental twist. But when the duo are left to their own devices—Alex Tsiridis as Rhyw and Hüseyin Evirgen as Magna Pia—their music gets even weirder. Evirgen debuted his solo project last year on Ed Davenport's label with Incantations, which boasted three spangled peak-time tracks and a dubbier warm-up (or down) track. ARCS-05, Evirgen's follow-up and his first solo outing on Arcing Seas, is subtler and better.
 This EP is all about the details. The title track is rubbery and ravey. There's not much to it, but tracing the morphing blips and buoyant beat is fun. ""Semiramis"" is a tease, and sounds pretty normal until those odd bass hits get tossed into the mix. There's also that soaring sensation that keeps on going after the drop. ""Akasha,"" an introverted trip, applies pressure from the low-end. Like the rest of ARCS-05, it's for sound nerds who like to get down.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21786
Malestripper - Distant Visions,October Records,OCT03,Techno,October 2017,1,3.5,"This 10-inch unveils DJ October's Malestripper alias, and comes with a sleeve photo and promo angle to match. The sleaze isn't new, mind—it was central to the Bristol-based Dutchman's grinding 2015 LP, Black Body Radiation, and present in earlier tracks in which he mined New York house for its erotic intensity. This record doesn't break any habits, and even compared to past instalments in the no-frills OCT series there's something familiar about it. Each track is a stylish, minimalist assemblage of October-trademark ideas, delivered like an endlessly rehearsed striptease.
 Moments of mixdown drama turn these hipthrusting 120-BPM groovers into dance floor aphrodisiac. On ""Distant Visions,"" a dry lead line flirts with chord stabs reverbed into a thick mist, making for stark changes of space. Just as the routine starts to drag, ethereal pads float into view. ""Raw MF'r"" is even more hip-grindingly deliberate, its kick drum a squat overdriven thud. It's also a bit fuller, with dub echo and grand pad moments revealing new contours in a mixdown so tactile you could almost reach out and grab it. No touching, mind.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21705
S U R V I V E - RR7387,Relapse Records,RR7387,Techno,November 2017,Post a comment,3.5,"There's something about the Texas group S U R V I V E that appeals across musical divides. A rock band and an electronic act, they occupy two niches in their hometown Austin scene. They're probably the only group that will release on the Italian electronic label Mannequin and the extreme metal label Relapse Records. Two of its members brought their music into the mainstream with Stranger Things, appealing to people who might not otherwise like electronic music. S U R V I V E look towards the dance floor on their latest EP, giving their noir-ish synth rock to producers associated with house and techno.  It's hard to imagine a producer more equipped to take on S U R V I V E than Lena Willikens, whose own music is also slow and spooky. Looping an anxious arpeggio from ""Cutthroat"" at 100 BPM, hers is the EP's most impressive remix. JK Flesh, AKA the extreme music pioneer Justin Broadrick, hits the EP's other home run with a shorter remix that rearranges ""Other"" into clammy industrial techno. The remaining two versions—a surprisingly restrained remix from Not Waving and a straight-up techno track from the Blondes member Sam Haar—aren't as strong. An act as distinctive as S U R V I V E will always be difficult to remix, but in the right hands their sound translates to techno surprisingly well.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21710
Diferit ‎- Ways To Dream,Why So Series,WSS005,"Minimal, House",November 2017,1,3.8,"Among the dozens of little-known Romanian producers who put out records each year, a few always stand out. In late 2016 it was Sublee, who dazzled with an intergalactic brand of tech house. Before him it was Melodie, who blended classic deep house with artful restraint. Cosmin Grigoriu, who producers as Diferit, is the latest to strike from obscurity with a killer EP.
 Ways To Dream, Diferit's second vinyl release, is all about the ten-minute A-side, ""Dreamscapes."" Played by Raresh, Barac and plenty of others in that league, it finds a perfect balance between colour and groove, packed with melodic details—synth squiggles, what sounds like a detuned flute—that squirm above the heaving low-end. When the extended breakdown hits, the mood goes from blissful to teary. ""Timepiece"" and ""Dust"" are less poignant but similarly detailed. Built around ticking high-end sounds and faint melody lines, the former is percussive with plenty of clicks and whistles. ""Dust"" is deeper and more abstract, with unfussy keys and that fat, crunchy clap so often heard in minimal tracks. Ways To Dream is an EP that doesn't sacrifice groove for emotion.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21819
Dream Cycle - Part One EP,Sneaker Social Club,SNKR011,"House, Broken Beat, Ambient",September 2017,1,3.5,"Sneaker Social Club declares allegiance to ""UK rave old and new,"" and the label's recent output has zig-zagged energetically between the two. Etch and West Norwood Cassette Library made hearty throwbacks to breakbeat hardcore's heyday, while dons of the era 2 Bad Mice produced shockingly good new work on last year's Gone To Soon EP. A reissue of a '92 classic, The Brothers Grimm's ""Exodus (The Lion Awakes),"" came with remixes from hardcore lovers like Special Request and The Maghreban.
 The label's latest riffs further on the theme. The story goes that its producer bonded with Sneaker head Jamie Russell over ""a shared love of 2 Bad Mice and Moving Shadow."" By this label's standards the EP's period echoes are oblique—here a diva sigh, there a hint of a rowdy bassline. Dream Cycle also weaves in later UK sounds. The excellent ""Dream 93"" could almost be Pangaea in his UK garage days, were it not for the sepia chords and winsome birdsong.  Elsewhere, the EP's main rhythm tends to be house. At its most pedestrian (""Start While It's Hot"") the effect is close to Lone's Ambivert Tools series. Most tracks are long and level, happy to wallow in a daze. The best offer more movement, reflecting the era's precipitous highs and lows, as when the paranoid ""S.O.U.R."" spills into the giddy euphoria of ""Paradise State."" The latter track features the EP's only actual breakbeats, filtered so that they flicker like mirages, and ends with a voice sighing, ""I gotta find my way back…"" But the EP isn't as depressingly nostalgic as that makes it sound. The ambient ""Absolutely (Them + Us Mix)"" is more affirmative than mournful, a dog-eared ode to loving and letting go.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21326
Regis - The Master Side,Blackest Ever Black,BLACKEST064,Techno,November 2017,13,4.0,"In recent months, Regis remixed his first album, Gymnastics, and released a live recording from 1997. Before that there was a compilation, a cassette and then a 7-inch featuring a track he made in 2001. All the EPs released since 2012's Death Head Said have centred on edits, live takes or old material, but no one seems to be complaining. The Master Side, however, appears to be new.
 Given how much time Regis has spent revisiting his back catalogue, it's tempting to read The Master Side as a synthesis of Gymnastics' jaw-clenching loops and the broken-beat stylings of his Blackest Ever Black material. The mono synth lines powering both sides recall tracks like ""Sand"" or a ""Cold Water,"" albeit slowed to a less urgent tempo. They act as rhythmic mainframes, steady yet shaping the flex of the groove. One of the quirks of Regis's catalogue is that, despite its sharp aesthetic, there's plenty of funk. This is what we get on both sides of this EP.
 ""Version 1"" buckles under huge sheets of white noise while syncopated kicks and the snare's wooden timbre emphasise the synth line's serpentine swerve. There's even a drop. ""Version 2"" has less white noise, which makes it more compact and tracky. The first minute, however, is dedicated to rustling textures that bring to mind the loose but tense sound of a Nurse With Wound production. This abstract angle is explored further near the runout grooves. Both sides end with nuanced outros, one with disarmingly plangent strings and the other with isolated electronics. Tucked away like hidden bonus tracks, they're deep and detailed, perhaps a sign that more non-techno material is on the way.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21741
A Sagittariun - Pseudo Science / Heavy Manners,Idle Hands,IDLE047,Techno,October 2017,3,3.7,"With A Sagittariun, Nick Harris has reinvented himself as a purveyor of cosmic techno. He's amassed a mostly self-released catalogue with the kind of range you could only get from absorbing decades of dance music. Before he was A Sagittariun, Harris was already a key player in Bristol's dance music scene—he's only recently owned up to being the man behind the name. He stays local with his first release for Idle Hands. He delivers two cuts of clever, melodic techno that cut up styles as well as any recent Idle Hands record.  Though Harris can make dance floor bombs, his dreamier tracks make the deepest impression. On ""Psuedo Science,"" a twinkling synth motif smoothly pulls the track skyward like a mass of helium balloons. It's hands-in-the-air material that feels serene and measured. The equally floaty ""Heavy Manners"" looks back to '90s UK dance music, with bobbing acid melodies and foggy chords. Both tracks offer the quietly inventive and colourful perspective we've come to expect from A Sagittariun, a project still finding new variations on techno.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21730
Borusiade - Silent,Cómeme,COMEME042,"New Wave, EBM",October 2017,Post a comment,3.9,"It's hard to talk about Borusiade's productions without referring to the murky corners of '80s DIY electronic music. But while terms like cold wave, minimal synth and EBM provide some guidance, they're just starting points for a sound that's hard to place.
 Silent, a preview from Borusiade's forthcoming LP on Cómeme, is streaked with lurid purples and dark blues. The momentum is rigid yet organic, like a coal-powered steam train clattering through the night. A ghost of human touch lingers in the air. Her voice, which comes off like a replicant, faintly longs for something lost and half-remembered, as if some distant trauma triggered amnesia. But she's robotically determined and bereft of sentimentality as the machine drives forth.  For all it's suggestiveness, ""Silent"" is about as direct a track as you'll find in Borusiade's discography. The dead simple bassline in the first break has dance floor mayhem written all over it. Afterwards, it's locked in an endless crest. Fellow Romanians Khidja inject an almost minimal-school level of detail into their remix. Whipping licks of noise lassoo around the edges of the mix while strange spectres lurk in the sidelines. There's enough strength in the effects, bass and groove that the pads, which come to dominate the track, could have been deployed more sparingly. But those soaring chords might be the highlight for other listeners.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21701
WK7 - Rhythm 1,Power House,PH909,House,November 2017,11,3.7,"There was a moment when Shed towered over electronic music, and his first two albums, soon to be re-released, remain landmarks. But for many the real magic happened on his EPs, which were smart, unfussy distillations of house and techno under now-legendary aliases like Wax and EQD. The heat has come off Shed's club productions lately, but they haven't gone entirely cold, and the whack-a-mole alias game continues.
 A key node is the Power House label, whose sound—a mixture of sexy '90s house and warehouse techno—says a lot about where Shed's at right now. With their grainy sonics and brutal compression settings, the tracks sometimes slip from '90s-influence into straighter mimicry. And it sometimes feels like, in the absence of fresh influence, Shed's music is starting to eat its own tail. Take this EP under his WK7 alias. Three of its tracks centre around a diva's vocal hook that goes, ""'cause rhythm is love."" And sure enough, the stars of the show are Shed's unmistakable rhythms, pumping assemblages of snap and snare shuffle.
 This hook on ""Rhythm 1"" plays out over cresting waves of rave paranoia and ripples hypnotically over sweet chords on ""Rhythm 2."" The latter track comes in two mixes—Shed likes a re-version these days. The ""Power Snap"" version gets a stiffer house rudder and ""Tripple H"" goes zero-gravity breakbeat. All three tracks are satisfying club weapons of the sort Shed can probably make in his sleep. Rounding off the EP, ""The Healer""'s cleaner house slouch wouldn't sound out of place on the ""Balearic rave""-leaning H2. Shed's aliases always were a rat maze, and there's still room to run.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21713
DJ Fett Burger - Track One,Mongo Fett,FETT303,"House, Techno, Downtempo",October 2017,10,4.1,"DJ Fett Burger refuses to play it straight. The Sex Tags cofounder pushes dubby ambient house excursions through a rat's nest of labels, collaborations and aliases. Finding the best Fett Burger tracks often feels like a search for the golden ticket. This year he's released two versions of a 12-inch called Pub 18 / 411 Esperanza, where only the most recent contains the brilliant breakbeat-laden house track ""Edging On The Street.""
 Felt Burger's Mongo Fett label has served as a home for his wackiest impulses. Track One is no exception. The title cut, ""Track One (Fast Slow West Coast Mix),"" was originally conceived as an SW. remix. It begins with an intro that sounds like Art Of Noise trying their hand at half-time trip-hop. A swinging ride is the only constant as the track mutates into wonky, excitable house, then goes slack again, like a carnival ride lurching into motion before coming to a sudden halt.  Though the A-side is the SW. remix, the B1, ""Dypfryst Pizza,"" would fit nicely alongside the SUED cofounder's excellent Reminder EP series, with starry-eyed retro chord house anchored by lush pads. The ambient outro, ""Tortugas Tem,"" ends with the same outer-space synth pulses that open the record, this time with a catchy bassline that occasionally treads into Seinfeld territory. A foggy, unintelligible spoken word rings out over the murk. We don't know why it's there or what it's saying, just that it's another Fett Burger mystery.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21707
Serena Butler - Konstrukt 007,Konstrukt,KON007,"Techno, Experimental",November 2017,3,3.9,"Serena Butler's take on techno is esoteric and subaqueous, with arresting samples and unusual field recordings—dogs barking, for instance—capped off with provocative titles. This clearly isn't your average club fare, but most of it is made for dance floors—it's some of the most winsome experimental music around. Since debuting with a lush and hazy Blade Runner-referencing EP for Eerie, there's been a harder, dystopic follow-up for New York Haunted and the serene From The Cloud To Our Bodies for the artist's new Bene Tleilax label. (It's another nod to sci-fi—the label's name is from Dune, Frank Herbert's epic novel.) Konstrukt 007 is the rising talent's most accessible release yet, ideal for newcomers with a taste for the uncanny.
 ""Deep Sea Dive"" and ""Submerged Underworld"" live up their names. The former is a gorgeous head trip with sunken chords and plush percussion designed to make you feel immersed and safe. Having drawn you in, the latter switches the vibe with cascading synths and rolling drums that set a plaintive mood. Warm and dark tones then meet on ""We Are Adamantly Synthetic"" like the sheen of oil on water. ""When I Die I'll Go To Heaven Because I Served My Time In Hell"" is the cryptic climax, featuring sampled dialogue, abstract textures and a shimmering melody that wafts over the top—a typical Serena Butler move that leaves you suspended in mystery and eager for more.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21693
Yaeji - EP2,Godmode,GM137,"House, Hip-Hop",November 2017,8,3.8,"Whether she's rapping in English or Korean, Kathy Yaeji Lee makes house anthems that her fans sing along to. If she sounded shy on her first record, she comes out of her shell on EP2. She sounds almost commanding on ""Raingurl,"" a track whose chorus—""Make it rain girl, make it rain!""—is already a fan favourite at shows. She raps more assertively than before, but her lyrics don't always hold water. ""When the sweaty walls are bangin' / I don't fuck with family planning"" is one of a few odd lines on ""Raingurl.""  Lee's depth shows when she pulls back. On the stunning ""Drink I'm Sippin On,"" she switches gears to a trap-influenced rhythm with soft contours that wrap around her voice like fog from a smoke machine. ""Drink I'm Sippin On,"" along with ""Feelings Change,"" lays out the instant appeal of Lee's music, especially to new and younger dance music fans. She's an unassuming artist who can rock a party with a whisper and a geek who loves rap music, which her easygoing cover of Drake's ""Passionfruit"" shows. Lee navigates dance music from outside the system (she mostly plays rock clubs) and swerves its clichés (she says that ""Drink I'm Sippin On"" isn't about alcohol). It might explain why she's earned such a large fanbase outside house music while courting the style's fans with an irresistible cool.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21728
Floating Points - Ratio,Pluto,"House, Deep House, Ambie",FPL03R,October 2017,16,3.6,"Cruise the comment sections of Floating Points-related content on Resident Advisor and the same sentiment crops up again and again: please make more music in your original style. This is a common request from dance music fans, but it seems to apply particularly strongly to the Pluto boss, AKA Sam Shepherd. His output has gone through a dramatic shift in the past three years, from gloriously quirky club tracks to meandering ambient songs that have more in common with prog rock than house and techno. As well received as recent records like Elaenia and Kuiper were, there were still grumblings. ""We can all pretend we like this as much as ""Vacuum Boogie"" and ""Nuits Sonores,"" but we don't really do we?"" wrote one commenter in 2016.  Shepherd's latest release, a one-track EP called Ratio, feels like a compromise between his two musical worlds. At its best, the 19-minute title cut, which is so long it had to be deconstructed for vinyl, is a banging dance floor record, full of glistening melodies, synthy earworms and dynamic shifts in pace and tension. But as compelling as the first nine minutes are, it's hard to stay focussed through the gentle three-minute breakdown, let alone the subsequent seven-minute wind-down. (The shrill bleeps and driving horns that did so much in the first half never return.) Ratio won't be considered a classic, but it'll still scratch that long-endured itch.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21731
Black Noi$e - Time Crisis,Portage Garage Sounds,PGS003,House,October 2017,Post a comment,3.8,"Black Noi$e must be a voracious listener. His SoundCloud page is mostly rap songs he produced, though you'll also hear throwback electro and quirky house. Check out last year's mix with Abby—another staple of Detroit's younger, weirder party scene—and you'll hear them careen between '90s ghettotech, SoundCloud rap, footwork and instrumental grime.  But Black Noi$e also has a traditional side, which we hear on ""V98.7,"" the closer from his latest EP, Time Crisis. It's built on a dusty soul sample, the kind of simple loop you'd expect to hear in a J Dilla track, with filtering and a vibrato that gives it a spectral touch. Pair that with congas, hi-hats and a kick drum that bumps without overpowering the mix and you've got an unhurried but irresistible house cut.  That's the EP's only nostalgic moment. ""Fight Riff,"" the other highlight, has colorful synths and a big bassline, with wacky percussion made from whirring noises and guitar strokes that shouldn't work, but do. ""Creepy Crawlers"" is the toughest cut, with a sassy clap and flourishes of effects that make it feel like it's running off the rails. ""232"" is another sample-heavy track, with a guitar lick that loops for the whole five minutes, crackling through a few layers of distortion. It's refreshingly weird and, like the other three tunes, full of fresh ideas that emerge when you aren't burdened by the past.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21706
Burial - Pre Dawn / Indoors,NonPlus+,NONPLUS043,"Techno, Electronica",November 2017,32,3.7,"Ten years on, Untrue's place in the canon is assured. It must be nice having a modern masterpiece to your name, but it also throws up problems: where do you go next? Burial has explored a few paths with mixed success. There were the big-room gestures of Rival Dealer and Kindred, which risked drowning in schmaltz, and the ambient Subtemple and Young Death / Nightmarket. The recent ""Rodent"" was more dance floor-friendly, but without the crackly intrigue. Another route involves ditching the sweet, redemptive mood—Kode9 called this the ""audio duvet""—that has helped make Burial's music such a lasting favourite. Following 2015's paranoid ""Temple Sleeper,"" Pre Dawn / Indoors probes this idea further. The result is far from the weepy Untrue, but as new directions go it's not half bad.  Burial's tracks tend to evoke narratives around the club rather than inviting club use themselves. The same goes for ""Pre Dawn,"" which depicts one of those semi-coherent nights out that picks up a terrifying momentum as it goes. The track's thunderous drums clock in circa 140 BPM and the melody howls like an arctic gale. The deathly energy grows, but so does the smothering layer of crackle and hiss. It's as if the dance floor experience has got so intense you've started to dissociate—the body is battered by sound, the brain glitches and partially shuts down. Eventually ""Pre Dawn"" becomes dawn, and a grand synth passage enters, fizzing with nervous exhaustion. A voice sums it up: ""Late at night… the energy… take me to the dream world.""
 ""Indoors"" is a weaker take on the same idea. This time the melody comes from a wordless singer, and the daybreak moment from cheesy piano chords. A chipmunked vocal loop heightens the track's death drive, but somehow the whole thing doesn't quite gel. Over a decade into his career, Burial is still chasing those moments where his strange sound collages fit together like puzzle pieces of the sublime. Sometimes he manages it, sometimes not.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21727
Mall Grab ‎- I'll Be In Paris On Sunday If You're About?,ava.,AVA013,House,October 2017,3,3.6,"The craze over lo-fi house has left the scene with a handful of once-anonymous stars whose tracks—first heard on YouTube—have led to international DJ bookings, debut albums and a chance to break out of the confines of the style. This crop includes Ross From Friends, who's currently touring a live show, DJ Seinfeld, whose debut LP is diverse and moody, and Mall Grab, who's now one of the biggest names in dance music. The young Australian, real name Jordon Alexander, emerged as the poster child of the style with YouTube anthems like ""Feel U."" He's followed up with a steady output of records and fun-filled DJ sets that have kept his momentum rising.  Alexander's latest 12-inch, I'll Be In Paris On Sunday If You're About?, on Damiano Von Erckert's Ava. Records, contains tracks that will sound familiar to fans. The record's lead tune, ""Caught Slippin',"" features a clever War sample amidst a slinky 4/4 house groove. ""Out Of Time"" sees Alexander explore his trippier side with a chopped-up vocal floating around muffled breaks and a simple synth line. ""Ahmad"" and a Von Erckert remix close out the record with Mall Grab's signature muffled kick drum. While the EP doesn't dip into techno or disco house like some of Alexander's recent releases, it's clear he hasn't lost his trademark touch.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21711
Traag - Money Orientated,Gang of Ducks,GODCUTS001,Experimental,October 2017,1,3.3,"Even in the social media age, the Italian label Gang Of Ducks has stayed mysterious. Records from the likes of Dave Saved, S Olbricht and Shape Worship sucked techno, trance and IDM into a black hole of weirdness. Money Orientated begins a new series called G.O.D. Cuts, which is meant for ""super-limited EPs."" The first release, from the Michigan duo Traag, is murky enough for the concept.
 Money Orientated was inspired by the duo's dissatisfaction with Michigan's noise music scene, which they say is churning out ""bad, washed EBM beats."" They counteract this with the most sluggish and uncomfortable music they can muster. Horses neigh on the extremely slow ""Para Caminar"" while creepy voices whisper, ""It doesn't exist"" on the dreary ""Suburban 53."" Dreary is the operative word on Money Orientated, where even the jackhammer drums on ""Black Horse"" feel like they're dragging their feet. There are brief flickers of something else, like the broken grime beat of ""South Towne"" or the gunshot samples of ""Fountain Park,"" but they're dots on a black backdrop. Money Orientated is one of the most challenging records Gang Of Ducks has released. It should delight some fans while alienating others.",https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/21695
